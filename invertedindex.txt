INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS
 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
 :  T2,
THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be

 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

 :  T4,
THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the

THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.

THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.
 :  T5,

 :  T5,
between this and our stellar universe.]

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

CHARLES DARWIN
 :  T6,
Greatest of naturalists, who made the idea of evolution current
 :  T6,
intellectual coin, and in his _Origin of Species_ (1859) made the whole
 :  T6,
world new.]
 :  T6,
LORD KELVIN
 :  T6,
One of the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He estimated
 :  T6,
the age of the earth at 20,000,000 years. He had not at his disposal,
 :  T6,
however, the knowledge of recent discoveries, which have resulted in
 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]
 :  T6,
A GIANT SPIRAL NEBULA
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous theory was that the planets and the earth were formed
 :  T6,
from great whirling nebulæ.]
 :  T6,
METEORITE WHICH FELL NEAR SCARBOROUGH, AND IS NOW TO BE SEEN IN THE
 :  T6,
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM
 :  T6,
It weighs about 56 lb., and is a "stony" meteorite, i.e., an aerolite.]
 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

Showing in order of evolution the general relations of the chief classes
 :  T6,
into which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents
 :  T6,
the present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]
 :  T6,
(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.
 :  T6,
FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.
 :  T6,

 :  T6,
TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.
 :  T6,
§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]

EARTHWORM

The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,

 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.

The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
1. A sensory nerve-cell (S.C.) on the surface receives a stimulus.
 :  T6,
2. The stimulus travels along the sensatory nerve-fibre (S.F.)
 :  T6,
3. The sensory nerve-fibre branches in the nerve-cord.
 :  T6,
4. Its branches come into close contact (SY^{1}) with those of an
 :  T6,
associative or communicating nerve-cell (A.C.).
 :  T6,
5. Other branches of the associative cell come into close contact
 :  T6,
(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]
 :  T6,
THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an
 :  T6,
exudation of digestive juice.]

 :  T6,
A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
 :  T6,
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up
 :  T6,
towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.
 :  T7,
PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]
 :  T7,
One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]
 :  T7,
SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.
 :  T7,
THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.

EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!

The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh._)
 :  T7,
The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
 :  T7,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
 :  T7,
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
 :  T7,
type.]
 :  T7,

 :  T7,

 :  T7,
reaches the ground on each foot, but the remains of two others are
 :  T7,
prominent.

 :  T7,
shoulder. Pliocene, N. America.
 :  T7,
6. The modern horse, running on the third digit of each foot.]
 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.

FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,

 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,
ants and bees.
 :  T8,
Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

 :  T8,

 :  T8,
polar bear in captivity has been seen making a current with its paw in
 :  T8,
the water of its pool in order to secure floating buns without
 :  T8,
trouble--an instance of sheer intelligence.]

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

The radium rays are made to strike a screen, producing visible spots of
 :  T9,
light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be
 :  T9,
deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.

 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.

The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]
 :  T9,
Radium" (John Murray)._
 :  T9,
SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in

 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]

 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]
 :  T9, T10,
THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

 :  T1,
the planet Neptune by calculations based on the irregularities of the

 :  T1,
Science.]

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
 :  T2,
THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

 :  T4,
THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the

THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.
 :  T5, T9,
THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

LORD KELVIN

 :  T6,
the age of the earth at 20,000,000 years. He had not at his disposal,

however, the knowledge of recent discoveries, which have resulted in
 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

into which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents
 :  T6,
the present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]
 :  T6,
(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.
 :  T6,
FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.
 :  T6,
§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

 :  T6,
tentacles round the mouth. It is seen giving off a bud, a clear
 :  T6,

 :  T6,
organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]
 :  T6,
EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
Earthworms began the profitable habit of moving with one end of the body
 :  T6,
always in front, and from worms to man the great majority of animals
 :  T6,
have bilateral symmetry.]

 :  T6,

 :  T6,

 :  T6,
7. The chromosomes lie at the equator, and each is split longitudinally.
 :  T6,
The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

GLASS MODEL OF A SEA-ANEMONE
 :  T6,
A long tubular sea-anemone, with a fine crown of tentacles around the

 :  T6,
lassoes on the tentacles minute animals on which it feeds are paralysed
 :  T6,
and captured for food.]
 :  T6,
TO MAN
 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,
other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,
 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,

(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]

THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an

exudation of digestive juice.]

A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
 :  T6,
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up

towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.
 :  T7,
PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]
 :  T7,
One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]

SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.

THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.
 :  T7,
EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh._)
 :  T7,
The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
 :  T7,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
 :  T7,
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
 :  T7,
type.]

 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.
 :  T7,
FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much

Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,

Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.

 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.
 :  T9,
§ 9
 :  T9,
The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]

SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]
 :  T10,
    [5] _Matter and Energy_, by Professor Soddy.
 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The

THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]

A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS
 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

 :  T1,
the planet Neptune by calculations based on the irregularities of the

 :  T1,
Science.]

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

 :  T1,
Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,

Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing

disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.

THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be
 :  T4,
counted.]
 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.

THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

the age of the earth at 20,000,000 years. He had not at his disposal,

 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.

FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

 :  T6,
TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.

§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

GREEN HYDRA
 :  T6,
A little freshwater polyp, about half an inch long, with a crown of
 :  T6,
tentacles round the mouth. It is seen giving off a bud, a clear
 :  T6,
illustration of asexual reproduction. When a tentacle touches some small
 :  T6,
organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]
 :  T6,
EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
Earthworms began the profitable habit of moving with one end of the body
 :  T6,
always in front, and from worms to man the great majority of animals
 :  T6,
have bilateral symmetry.]

 :  T6,
represented as rods.
 :  T6,
2. A mature sperm-cell, with 2 chromosomes.
 :  T6,
3. An immature _egg_-cell, with 4 chromosomes represented as curved
 :  T6,
bodies.
 :  T6,
4. A mature egg-cell, with 2 chromosomes.
 :  T6,
5. The spermatozoon fertilises the ovum, introducing 2 chromosomes.
 :  T6,
6. The fertilised ovum, with 4 chromosomes, 2 of paternal origin and 2
 :  T6,
of maternal origin.
 :  T6,
7. The chromosomes lie at the equator, and each is split longitudinally.
 :  T6,
The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]
 :  T6,
GLASS MODEL OF A SEA-ANEMONE
 :  T6,
A long tubular sea-anemone, with a fine crown of tentacles around the
 :  T6,
mouth. The suggestion of a flower is very obvious. By means of stinging
 :  T6,
lassoes on the tentacles minute animals on which it feeds are paralysed
 :  T6,
and captured for food.]
 :  T6,
TO MAN
 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,
other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,
 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
1. A sensory nerve-cell (S.C.) on the surface receives a stimulus.
 :  T6,
2. The stimulus travels along the sensatory nerve-fibre (S.F.)
 :  T6,
3. The sensory nerve-fibre branches in the nerve-cord.
 :  T6,
4. Its branches come into close contact (SY^{1}) with those of an
 :  T6,
associative or communicating nerve-cell (A.C.).
 :  T6,
5. Other branches of the associative cell come into close contact
 :  T6,
(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]
 :  T6,
THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an
 :  T6,
exudation of digestive juice.]

 :  T6,
A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
 :  T6,
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up
 :  T6,
towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.

PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]

One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]

SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.
 :  T7,
THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.
 :  T7,
EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,

 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.
 :  T7,
FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,
ants and bees.
 :  T8,
Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

 :  T8,

 :  T8,

 :  T8,
trouble--an instance of sheer intelligence.]

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

 :  T9,
The radium rays are made to strike a screen, producing visible spots of
 :  T9,
light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be
 :  T9,
deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.
 :  T9,
A. Magnifying lens. B. A zinc sulphite screen. C. A needle on whose
 :  T9,
point is placed a speck of radium.
 :  T9,
The lower picture shows the screen and needle magnified.]
 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.
 :  T9,
§ 9
 :  T9,
The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]
 :  T9,
Radium" (John Murray)._
 :  T9,
SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.

 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]

    [5] _Matter and Energy_, by Professor Soddy.
 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]
 :  T9, T10,
THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 :  T10,
Literary Archive Foundation
 :  T10,
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 :  T10,
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 :  T10,
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 :  T10,
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 :  T10,
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 :  T10,

 :  T10,
status with the IRS.
 :  T10,
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 :  T10,

 :  T10,
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 :  T10,
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 :  T10,
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 :  T10,
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 :  T10,
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 :  T10,

approach us with offers to donate.
 :  T10,
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 :  T10,
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 :  T10,
works.
 :  T7, T10,
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 :  T10,
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 :  T10,
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 :  T10,
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 :  T10,
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 :  T10,
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 :  T10,
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 :  T10,
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS
 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
 :  T2,
THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be
 :  T4,

 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

 :  T4,
THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the

THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.

THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

 :  T5,

 :  T5,
between this and our stellar universe.]

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

LORD KELVIN
 :  T6,
One of the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He estimated
 :  T6,
the age of the earth at 20,000,000 years. He had not at his disposal,
 :  T6,
however, the knowledge of recent discoveries, which have resulted in
 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

Showing in order of evolution the general relations of the chief classes
 :  T6,
into which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents
 :  T6,
the present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]
 :  T6,
(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.
 :  T6,
FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.
 :  T6,

 :  T6,
TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.
 :  T6,
§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]

EARTHWORM
 :  T6,

have bilateral symmetry.]

The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

A long tubular sea-anemone, with a fine crown of tentacles around the

TO MAN
 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,

 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

 :  T6, T8, T9,
Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
1. A sensory nerve-cell (S.C.) on the surface receives a stimulus.
 :  T6,
2. The stimulus travels along the sensatory nerve-fibre (S.F.)
 :  T6,
3. The sensory nerve-fibre branches in the nerve-cord.
 :  T6,
4. Its branches come into close contact (SY^{1}) with those of an
 :  T6,
associative or communicating nerve-cell (A.C.).
 :  T6,
5. Other branches of the associative cell come into close contact
 :  T6,
(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]
 :  T6,
THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an
 :  T6,
exudation of digestive juice.]

 :  T6,
A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
 :  T6,
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up
 :  T6,
towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.
 :  T7,
PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]
 :  T7,
One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]
 :  T7,
SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.
 :  T7,
THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.

EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh._)
 :  T7,
The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
 :  T7,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
 :  T7,
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
 :  T7,
type.]
 :  T7,

 :  T7,

 :  T7,
reaches the ground on each foot, but the remains of two others are
 :  T7,
prominent.

 :  T7,
shoulder. Pliocene, N. America.
 :  T7,
6. The modern horse, running on the third digit of each foot.]
 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.

FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,
ants and bees.
 :  T8,
Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

ice. The food consists chiefly of seals. The sexes wander separately. A
 :  T8,
hole is often dug as a winter retreat, but there is no hibernation. A
 :  T8,
polar bear in captivity has been seen making a current with its paw in
 :  T8,
the water of its pool in order to secure floating buns without
 :  T8,
trouble--an instance of sheer intelligence.]

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

 :  T9,
The radium rays are made to strike a screen, producing visible spots of
 :  T9,
light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be
 :  T9,
deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.

 :  T9,
point is placed a speck of radium.

 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.

The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]
 :  T9,
Radium" (John Murray)._
 :  T9,
SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]

 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]
 :  T9, T10,
THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

who, anticipating the great French mathematician, Le Verrier, discovered
 :  T1,
the planet Neptune by calculations based on the irregularities of the
 :  T1,
orbit of Uranus. One of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of
 :  T1,
Science.]

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
 :  T2,
THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

this cluster is such that it would take light more than 100,000 years to
 :  T4,
reach us.]
 :  T4,
THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the

nucleus.] :  T4,
THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.
 :  T5, T9,
THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

into which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents
 :  T6,
the present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]
 :  T6,
(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.

FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.

§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

 :  T6,
tentacles round the mouth. It is seen giving off a bud, a clear

 :  T6,
organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]
 :  T6,
EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
Earthworms began the profitable habit of moving with one end of the body
 :  T6,
always in front, and from worms to man the great majority of animals
 :  T6,
have bilateral symmetry.]

 :  T6,

7. The chromosomes lie at the equator, and each is split longitudinally.
 :  T6,
The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

GLASS MODEL OF A SEA-ANEMONE
 :  T6,
A long tubular sea-anemone, with a fine crown of tentacles around the

 :  T6,
lassoes on the tentacles minute animals on which it feeds are paralysed
 :  T6,
and captured for food.]

TO MAN
 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,
other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,
 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM

(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]

THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an

A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her

 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.
 :  T7,
PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]
 :  T7,
One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]

SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,

THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.
 :  T7,
EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh._)
 :  T7,
The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
 :  T7,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
 :  T7,
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
 :  T7,
type.]

 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.
 :  T7,
FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,

 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the

squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,

Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.

 :  T9,
point is placed a speck of radium.

 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.
 :  T9,
§ 9
 :  T9,
The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]

SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]
 :  T10,
    [5] _Matter and Energy_, by Professor Soddy.
 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]

THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS
 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

who, anticipating the great French mathematician, Le Verrier, discovered
 :  T1,
the planet Neptune by calculations based on the irregularities of the

orbit of Uranus. One of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of
 :  T1,
Science.]

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

 :  T1,
Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.

THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be
 :  T4,
counted.]
 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.

THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.

FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

 :  T6,
TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.

§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

GREEN HYDRA
 :  T6,
A little freshwater polyp, about half an inch long, with a crown of
 :  T6,
tentacles round the mouth. It is seen giving off a bud, a clear
 :  T6,
illustration of asexual reproduction. When a tentacle touches some small
 :  T6,
organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]

EARTHWORM

Earthworms began the profitable habit of moving with one end of the body
 :  T6,
always in front, and from worms to man the great majority of animals
 :  T6,
have bilateral symmetry.]

The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

GLASS MODEL OF A SEA-ANEMONE
 :  T6,
A long tubular sea-anemone, with a fine crown of tentacles around the
 :  T6,
mouth. The suggestion of a flower is very obvious. By means of stinging
 :  T6,
lassoes on the tentacles minute animals on which it feeds are paralysed
 :  T6,
and captured for food.]
 :  T6,
TO MAN
 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,
other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,
 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
1. A sensory nerve-cell (S.C.) on the surface receives a stimulus.
 :  T6,
2. The stimulus travels along the sensatory nerve-fibre (S.F.)
 :  T6,
3. The sensory nerve-fibre branches in the nerve-cord.
 :  T6,
4. Its branches come into close contact (SY^{1}) with those of an
 :  T6,
associative or communicating nerve-cell (A.C.).
 :  T6,
5. Other branches of the associative cell come into close contact
 :  T6,
(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]

THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an
 :  T6,
exudation of digestive juice.]

 :  T6,
A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
 :  T6,
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up
 :  T6,
towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.

PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]

One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]

SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.
 :  T7,
THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to

The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.

EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,

There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.
 :  T7,
FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much

more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,
ants and bees.
 :  T8,
Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

 :  T8,

 :  T8,

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

resulting from collision with atoms.]
 :  T9,
The radium rays are made to strike a screen, producing visible spots of
 :  T9,
light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be
 :  T9,
deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.

Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.
 :  T9,
A. Magnifying lens. B. A zinc sulphite screen. C. A needle on whose
 :  T9,
point is placed a speck of radium.
 :  T9,
The lower picture shows the screen and needle magnified.]
 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.
 :  T9,
§ 9
 :  T9,
The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]
 :  T9,
Radium" (John Murray)._
 :  T9,
SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]

    [5] _Matter and Energy_, by Professor Soddy.
 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]
 :  T9, T10,
THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

 :  T10,
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 :  T10,
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 :  T10,
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 :  T10,
works.
 :  T7, T10,
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 :  T10,
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 :  T10,
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 :  T10,
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS
 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
 :  T2,
THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be
 :  T4,

 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.
 :  T4,
The Mountains of the Moon
 :  T4,
The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
 :  T4,
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

 :  T4,
THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the

THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.

We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.

THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

LORD KELVIN

One of the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He estimated
 :  T6,
the age of the earth at 20,000,000 years. He had not at his disposal,

however, the knowledge of recent discoveries, which have resulted in
 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

Showing in order of evolution the general relations of the chief classes
 :  T6,
into which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents
 :  T6,
the present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]
 :  T6,
(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.
 :  T6,
FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

 :  T6,
TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.
 :  T6,
§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

EARTHWORM

The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,

which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
1. A sensory nerve-cell (S.C.) on the surface receives a stimulus.
 :  T6,
2. The stimulus travels along the sensatory nerve-fibre (S.F.)
 :  T6,
3. The sensory nerve-fibre branches in the nerve-cord.
 :  T6,
4. Its branches come into close contact (SY^{1}) with those of an
 :  T6,
associative or communicating nerve-cell (A.C.).
 :  T6,
5. Other branches of the associative cell come into close contact
 :  T6,
(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]
 :  T6,
THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP
 :  T6,
One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
 :  T6,
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an
 :  T6,
exudation of digestive juice.]

 :  T6,
A SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS
 :  T6,
A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
 :  T6,
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up
 :  T6,
towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
 :  T6,
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]
 :  T6,
Reflex Actions
 :  T6,
Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
 :  T6,
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.
 :  T7,
PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one
 :  T7,
championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]
 :  T7,
One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]
 :  T7,
SWOOPING
 :  T7,
Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.
 :  T7,
THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.
 :  T7,
EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh._)
 :  T7,
The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
 :  T7,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
 :  T7,
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
 :  T7,
type.]
 :  T7,

 :  T7,

 :  T7,
reaches the ground on each foot, but the remains of two others are
 :  T7,
prominent.

 :  T7,
shoulder. Pliocene, N. America.
 :  T7,
6. The modern horse, running on the third digit of each foot.]
 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.

FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,
ants and bees.
 :  T8,
Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

 :  T8,

 :  T8,
polar bear in captivity has been seen making a current with its paw in

 :  T8,
trouble--an instance of sheer intelligence.]

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

The radium rays are made to strike a screen, producing visible spots of
 :  T9,
light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be
 :  T9,
deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.

 :  T9,

 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.

The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]
 :  T9,
Radium" (John Murray)._
 :  T9,
SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]

 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]
 :  T9, T10,
THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 :  T1,
By Professor J. Arthur Thomson
 :  T1,
Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
 :  T1,
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
 :  T1,
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
 :  T1,
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
 :  T1,
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.
 :  T1,
It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
 :  T1,
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
 :  T1,
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
 :  T1,
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
 :  T1,
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
 :  T1,
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.
 :  T1,
What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
 :  T1,
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
 :  T1,
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
 :  T1,
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
 :  T1,
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
 :  T1,
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
 :  T1,
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
 :  T1,
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
 :  T1,
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
 :  T1,
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
 :  T1,
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
 :  T1,
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
 :  T1,
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
 :  T1,
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
 :  T1,
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
 :  T1,
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
 :  T1,
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.
 :  T1,
We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
 :  T1,
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
 :  T1,
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
 :  T1,
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
 :  T1,
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
 :  T1,
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
 :  T1,
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
 :  T1,
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
 :  T1,
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
 :  T1,
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
 :  T1,
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
 :  T1,
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
 :  T1,
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
 :  T1,
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
 :  T1,
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
 :  T1,
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science
 :  T1,
INTRODUCTION
 :  T1,
There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
 :  T1,
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
 :  T1,
the eventfulness of recent advances?
 :  T1,
But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
 :  T1,
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
 :  T1,
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
 :  T1,
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
 :  T1,
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
 :  T1,
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
 :  T1,
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
 :  T1,
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
 :  T1,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
 :  T1,
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
 :  T1,
the world always new.
 :  T1,
The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
 :  T1,
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
 :  T1,
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
 :  T1,
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
 :  T1,
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
 :  T1,
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
 :  T1,
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
 :  T1,
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.
 :  T1,
The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
 :  T1,
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
 :  T1,
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
 :  T1,
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
 :  T1,
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
 :  T1,
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
 :  T1,
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
 :  T1,
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
 :  T1,
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
 :  T1,
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
 :  T1,
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
 :  T1,
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T1,
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
 :  T1,
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
 :  T1,
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
 :  T1,
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.
 :  T1,
It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
 :  T1,
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
 :  T1,
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
 :  T1,
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
 :  T1,
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
 :  T1,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
 :  T1,
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
 :  T1,
by the board.
 :  T1,
The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
 :  T1,
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
 :  T1,
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
 :  T1,
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
 :  T1,
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
 :  T1,
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
 :  T1,
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
 :  T1,
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
 :  T1,
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.
 :  T1,
The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
 :  T1,
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
 :  T1,
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
 :  T1,
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
 :  T1,
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
 :  T1,
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
 :  T1,
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
 :  T1,
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
 :  T1,
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is :  T1,
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
 :  T1,
have been evolved?
 :  T1,
But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
 :  T1,
which give modern science an entrancing interest.
 :  T1,
As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
 :  T1,
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
 :  T1,
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
 :  T1,
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
 :  T1,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
 :  T1,
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
 :  T1,
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
 :  T1,
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
 :  T1,
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
 :  T1,
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
 :  T1,
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
 :  T1,
past generation.
 :  T1,
The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
 :  T1,
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
 :  T1,
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
 :  T1,
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
 :  T1,
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
 :  T1,
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
 :  T1,
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
 :  T1,
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
 :  T1,
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
 :  T1,
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
 :  T1,
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
 :  T1,
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
 :  T1,
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.
 :  T1,
The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
 :  T1,
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
 :  T1,
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
 :  T1,
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
 :  T1,
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
 :  T1,
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
 :  T1,
this OUTLINE will deal.
 :  T1,
The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
 :  T1,
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
 :  T1,
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
 :  T1,
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
 :  T1,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
 :  T1,
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
 :  T1,
sometimes difficult to find.
 :  T1,
Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
 :  T1,
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
 :  T1,
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
 :  T1,
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
 :  T1,
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.
 :  T1,
The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
 :  T1,
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
 :  T1,
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
 :  T1,
continued conquest of his kingdom.

 :  T1,
THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
§ 1
 :  T1, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
 :  T1,
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
 :  T1,
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
 :  T1,
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
 :  T1,
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
 :  T1,
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.
 :  T1,
    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
 :  T1,
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
 :  T1,
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
 :  T1,
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
 :  T1,
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
 :  T1,
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
 :  T1,
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
 :  T1,
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
 :  T1,
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
 :  T1,
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
 :  T1,
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
 :  T1,
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
 :  T1,
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
 :  T1,
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
 :  T1,
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
 :  T1,
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
 :  T1,
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
 :  T1,
    our conclusions.
 :  T1,
The Heavenly Bodies
 :  T1,
The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
 :  T1,
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
 :  T1,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
 :  T1,
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
 :  T1,
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
 :  T1,
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
 :  T1,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
 :  T1,
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
 :  T1,
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
 :  T1,
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
 :  T1,
is called the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
 :  T1,
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
 :  T1,
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
 :  T1,
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
 :  T1,
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
 :  T1,
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
 :  T1,
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
 :  T1,
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
 :  T1,
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
 :  T1,
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
 :  T1,
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
 :  T1,
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
 :  T1,
double this distance from the earth.
 :  T1,
We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
 :  T1,
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
 :  T1,
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
 :  T1,
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
 :  T1,
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
 :  T1,
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
 :  T1,
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
 :  T1,
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
 :  T1,
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
 :  T1,
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

 :  T1,
who, anticipating the great French mathematician, Le Verrier, discovered
 :  T1,
the planet Neptune by calculations based on the irregularities of the
 :  T1,
orbit of Uranus. One of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of
 :  T1,
Science.]

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
 :  T1,
(Drawn approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
 :  T1,
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
 :  T1,
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
 :  T1,
time as we use them; that is :  T1,
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
 :  T1,
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
 :  T1,
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
 :  T1,
the Sun.]
 :  T1,
approximately to scale)
 :  T1,
On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
 :  T1,
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
 :  T1,
than all the other planets put together.]
 :  T1,
Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
 :  T1,
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
 :  T1,
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
 :  T1,
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
 :  T1,
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
 :  T1,
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
 :  T1,
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
 :  T1,
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
 :  T1,
prodigious speed.
 :  T1,
In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
 :  T1,
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
 :  T1,
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
 :  T1,
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
 :  T1,
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
 :  T1,
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
 :  T1,
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
 :  T1,
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
 :  T1,
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
 :  T1,
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
 :  T1,
to their orbits.
 :  T1,
Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
 :  T1,
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
 :  T1,
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
 :  T1,
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
 :  T1,
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
 :  T1,
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
 :  T1,
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.
 :  T1,
The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
 :  T1,
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
 :  T1,
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
 :  T1,
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
 :  T1,
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
 :  T1,
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
 :  T1,
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
 :  T1,
be life, as we know life.
 :  T1,
If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
 :  T1,
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
 :  T1,
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
 :  T1,
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
 :  T1,
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
 :  T1,
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
 :  T1,
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
 :  T1,
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
 :  T1,
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
 :  T1,
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
 :  T1,
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
 :  T1,
like ours.
 :  T1,
§ 2
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7,
The Scale of the Universe
 :  T1,
How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
 :  T1,
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
 :  T1,
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
 :  T1,
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
 :  T1,
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
 :  T1,
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
 :  T1,
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
 :  T1,
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
 :  T1,
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
 :  T1,
thousand million stars.
 :  T1,
Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
 :  T1,
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
 :  T1,
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
 :  T1,
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
 :  T1,
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
 :  T1,
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
 :  T1,
the Solar System.
 :  T1,
The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
 :  T1,
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
 :  T1,
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
 :  T1,
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
 :  T1,
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
 :  T1,
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
 :  T1,
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
 :  T1,
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
 :  T1,
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
 :  T1,
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
 :  T1,
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of us.
 :  T1,
This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
 :  T1,
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
 :  T1,
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
 :  T1,
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
 :  T1,
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
 :  T1,
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
 :  T1,
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
 :  T1,
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
 :  T1,
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
 :  T1,
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
 :  T1,
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.
 :  T1,
Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
 :  T1,
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
 :  T1,
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
 :  T1,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
 :  T1,
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
 :  T1,
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
 :  T1,
is what we call our universe.
 :  T1,
Are there other Universes?
 :  T1,
Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
 :  T1,
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
 :  T1,
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
 :  T1,
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
 :  T1,
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
 :  T1,
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
 :  T1,
abysses of space. Probably there are.
 :  T1,
For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
 :  T1,
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
 :  T1,
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
 :  T1,
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
 :  T1,
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
 :  T1,
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
 :  T1,
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
 :  T1,
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
 :  T1,
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
 :  T1,
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
 :  T1,
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
 :  T1,
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.
 :  T1,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 :  T1,
THE SUN
 :  T1, T2,
But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
 :  T1,
own little colony.
 :  T1,
Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
 :  T1,
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
 :  T1,
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
 :  T1,
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
 :  T1,
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
 :  T1,
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
 :  T1,
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?
 :  T1,
These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
 :  T1,
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
 :  T1,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
 :  T1,
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
 :  T1,
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
 :  T1,
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
 :  T1,
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
 :  T1,
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
 :  T1,
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
 :  T1,
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
 :  T1,
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
 :  T1,
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
 :  T1,
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
 :  T1,
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
 :  T1,
stars, as we shall see.
 :  T1,
    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
 :  T1,
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
 :  T1,
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
 :  T1,
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
 :  T1,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
 :  T1,
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
 :  T1,
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
 :  T1,
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."
 :  T1,
Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
 :  T1,
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
 :  T1,
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
 :  T1,
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
 :  T1,
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
 :  T1,
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
 :  T1,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
 :  T1,
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.
 :  T1,
The Solar System
 :  T1,
In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
 :  T1,
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
 :  T1,
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
 :  T1,
multitude of meteors :  T1,
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.
 :  T1,
The Sun
 :  T1,
Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
 :  T1,
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.
 :  T1,
Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
 :  T1,
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
 :  T1,
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
 :  T1,
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
 :  T1,
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
 :  T1,
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
 :  T1,
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
 :  T1,
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
 :  T1,
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
 :  T1,
named Coronium.
 :  T1,
We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
 :  T1,
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
 :  T1,
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
 :  T1,
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
 :  T1,
are presently.
 :  T1,
Regions of the Sun
 :  T1,
The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
 :  T1,
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
 :  T1,
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
 :  T1,
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
 :  T1,
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
 :  T1,
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
 :  T1,
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
 :  T1,
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.
 :  T1,
Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
 :  T1,
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
 :  T1,
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
 :  T1,
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.
 :  T1,
A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
 :  T1,
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
 :  T1,
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
 :  T1,
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
 :  T1,
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
 :  T1,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
 :  T1,
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
 :  T1,
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
 :  T1,
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
 :  T1,
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.
 :  T1,
During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
 :  T1,
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
 :  T1,
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
 :  T1,
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
 :  T1,
of 60,000 miles an hour.
 :  T1,
These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
 :  T1,
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
 :  T1,
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
 :  T1,
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
 :  T1,
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
 :  T1,
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
 :  T1,
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope :  T1,
    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
 :  T1,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
 :  T1,
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12 :  T1,
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
 :  T1,
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
 :  T1,
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
 :  T1,
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
 :  T1,
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
 :  T1,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
 :  T1,
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
 :  T1,
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
 :  T1,
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
 :  T1,
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
 :  T1,
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
 :  T1,
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
 :  T1,
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
 :  T1,
    still tower above them.[1]

immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have

already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
 :  T2,
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
 :  T2,
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.
 :  T2,
The Surface of the Sun
 :  T2,
Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
 :  T2,
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
 :  T2,
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
 :  T2,
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
 :  T2,
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
 :  T2,
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
 :  T2,
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
 :  T2,
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
 :  T2,
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
 :  T2,
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
 :  T2,
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
 :  T2,
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
 :  T2,
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
 :  T2,
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
 :  T2,
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
 :  T2,
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
 :  T2,
it were.
 :  T2,
The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
 :  T2,
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
 :  T2,
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
 :  T2,
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
 :  T2,
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
 :  T2,
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
 :  T2,
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
 :  T2,
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
 :  T2,
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
 :  T2,
power to reproduce it.
 :  T2,
Sun-spots
 :  T2,
It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
 :  T2,
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
 :  T2,
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
 :  T2,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
 :  T2,
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
 :  T2,
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
 :  T2,
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
 :  T2,
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
 :  T2,
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.
 :  T2,
Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
 :  T2,
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
 :  T2,
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
 :  T2,
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
 :  T2,
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
 :  T2,
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
 :  T2,
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
 :  T2,
storm" effects on the earth.
 :  T2,
A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
 :  T2,
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
 :  T2,
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
 :  T2,
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
 :  T2,
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
 :  T2,
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
 :  T2,
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
 :  T2,
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS
 :  T2,
The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
 :  T2,
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
 :  T2,
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
 :  T2,
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
 :  T2,
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
 :  T2,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
 :  T2,
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
 :  T2,
influence of the sun.]
 :  T2,
It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
 :  T2,
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
 :  T2,
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
 :  T2,
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
 :  T2,
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
 :  T2,
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
 :  T2,
solid body.
 :  T2,
What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
 :  T2,
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
 :  T2,
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
 :  T2,
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?
 :  T2,
It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
 :  T2,
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
 :  T2,
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
 :  T2,
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.
 :  T2,
A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS
 :  T2,
The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
 :  T2,
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
 :  T2,
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
 :  T2,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
 :  T2,
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
 :  T2,
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
 :  T2,
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
 :  T2,
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
 :  T2,
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
 :  T2,
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
 :  T2,
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
 :  T2,
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
 :  T2,
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
 :  T2,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
 :  T2,
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
 :  T2,
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
 :  T2,
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
 :  T2,
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
 :  T2,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
 :  T2,
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
 :  T2,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
 :  T2,
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
 :  T2,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
 :  T2,
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
 :  T2,
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
 :  T2,
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
 :  T2,
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.
 :  T2,
This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
 :  T2,
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
 :  T2,
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
 :  T2,
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
 :  T2,
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
 :  T2,
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
 :  T2,
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
 :  T2,
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.
 :  T2,
Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
 :  T2,
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
 :  T2,
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
 :  T2,
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
 :  T2,
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
 :  T2,
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
 :  T2,
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
 :  T2,
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
 :  T2,
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

 :  T2,
Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
 :  T2,
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
 :  T2,
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
 :  T2,
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
 :  T2,
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
 :  T2,
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
 :  T2,
identified by the characteristic set of waves.
 :  T2,
The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
 :  T2,
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
 :  T2,
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
 :  T2,
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
 :  T2,
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
 :  T2,
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
 :  T2,
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
 :  T2,
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
 :  T2,
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
 :  T2,
which it emits when hot.
 :  T2,
Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
 :  T2,
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
 :  T2,
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
 :  T2,
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
 :  T2,
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
 :  T2,
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
 :  T2,
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
 :  T2,
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
 :  T2,
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
 :  T2,
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
 :  T2,
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
 :  T2,
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
 :  T2,
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
 :  T2,
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
 :  T2,
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
 :  T2,
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
 :  T2,
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
 :  T2,
compounds to form.
 :  T2,
It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
 :  T2,
nebulæ are made of.
 :  T2,
A Unique Discovery
 :  T2,
In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
 :  T2,
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
 :  T2,
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
 :  T2,
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
 :  T2,
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
 :  T2,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
 :  T2,
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
 :  T2,
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
 :  T2,
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
 :  T2,
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
 :  T2,
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
 :  T2,
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.
 :  T2,
Measuring the Speed of Light
 :  T2,
But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
 :  T2,
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
 :  T2,
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
 :  T2,
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
 :  T2,
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
 :  T2,
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
 :  T2,
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
 :  T2,
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
 :  T2,
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
 :  T2,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
 :  T2,
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
 :  T2,
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
 :  T2,
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
 :  T2,
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
 :  T2,
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
 :  T2,
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
 :  T2,
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
 :  T2,
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
 :  T2,
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
 :  T2,
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.
 :  T2,
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES
 :  T2,
This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
 :  T2,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
 :  T2,
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
 :  T2,
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
 :  T2,
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
 :  T2,
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]
 :  T2,
IS THE SUN DYING?
 :  T2,
§ 3
 :  T2, T5, T6, T7,
Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.
 :  T2,
To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
 :  T2,
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
 :  T2,
from it without ceasing.
 :  T2,
Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
 :  T2,
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
 :  T2,
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
 :  T2,
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
 :  T2,
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
 :  T2,
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
 :  T2,
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
 :  T2,
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
 :  T2,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
 :  T2,
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
 :  T2,
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
 :  T2,
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
 :  T2,
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
 :  T2,
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
 :  T2,
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
 :  T2,
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
 :  T2,
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
 :  T2,
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.
 :  T2,
And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
 :  T2,
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
 :  T2,
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
 :  T2,
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
 :  T2,
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
 :  T2,
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
 :  T2,
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
 :  T2,
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.
 :  T2,
The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
 :  T2,
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
 :  T2,
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
 :  T2,
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
 :  T2,
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
 :  T2,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
 :  T2,
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
 :  T2,
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
 :  T2,
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
 :  T2,
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
 :  T2,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
 :  T2,
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
 :  T2,
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
 :  T2,
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
 :  T2,
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
 :  T2,
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
 :  T2,
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
 :  T2,
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
 :  T2,
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
 :  T2,
required.
 :  T2,
It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
 :  T2,
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
 :  T2,
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
 :  T2,
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
 :  T2,
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
 :  T2,
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
 :  T2,
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
 :  T2,
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
 :  T2,
for the sun's heat.
 :  T2,
Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
 :  T2,
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
 :  T2,
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
 :  T2,
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
 :  T2,
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
 :  T2,
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?
 :  T2,
The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
 :  T2,
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
 :  T2,
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.
 :  T2,
THE PLANETS
 :  T1, T3,
LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?
 :  T3,
It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
 :  T3,
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
 :  T3,
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
 :  T3,
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
 :  T3,
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
 :  T3,
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
 :  T3,
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
 :  T3,
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
 :  T3,
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
 :  T3,
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
 :  T3,
rest of the universe.
 :  T3,
In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
 :  T3,
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
 :  T3,
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
 :  T3,
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
 :  T3,
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
 :  T3,
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
 :  T3,
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
 :  T3,
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
 :  T3,
freezing-point.
 :  T3,
The Planet Venus
 :  T3,
The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
 :  T3,
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
 :  T3,
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
 :  T3,
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
 :  T3,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
 :  T3,
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
 :  T3,
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
 :  T3,
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
 :  T3,
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
 :  T3,
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
 :  T3,
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
 :  T3,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
 :  T3,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
 :  T3,
cloud-screen.

 :  T3,
We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
 :  T3,
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
 :  T3,
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.
 :  T3,
Is there Life on Mars?
 :  T3,
The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
 :  T3,
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
 :  T3,
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
 :  T3,
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
 :  T3,
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
 :  T3,
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
 :  T3,
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
 :  T3,
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
 :  T3,
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
 :  T3,
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.
 :  T3,
But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
 :  T3,
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
 :  T3,
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
 :  T3,
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
 :  T3,
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
 :  T3,
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
 :  T3,
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
 :  T3,
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
 :  T3,
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
 :  T3,
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
 :  T3,
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.
 :  T3,
Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
 :  T3,
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
 :  T3,
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
 :  T3,
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
 :  T3,
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
 :  T3,
planet.
 :  T3, T6,
If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
 :  T3,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
 :  T3,
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
 :  T3,
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
 :  T3,
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
 :  T3,
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
 :  T3,
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
 :  T3,
a good deal of controversy.
 :  T3,
In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
 :  T3,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
 :  T3,
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
 :  T3,
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
 :  T3,
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
 :  T3,
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
 :  T3,
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
 :  T3,
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
 :  T3,
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
 :  T3,
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
 :  T3,
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
 :  T3,
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
 :  T3,
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
 :  T3,
problems.
 :  T3,
Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
 :  T3,
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
 :  T3,
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
 :  T3,
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
 :  T3,
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
 :  T3,
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
 :  T3,
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
 :  T3,
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
 :  T3,
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.
 :  T3,
For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
 :  T3,
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
 :  T3,
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
 :  T3,
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
 :  T3,
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
 :  T3,
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
 :  T3,
But there is no life on Jupiter.
 :  T3,
The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
 :  T3,
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
 :  T3,
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
 :  T3,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
 :  T3,
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
 :  T3,
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
 :  T3,
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
 :  T3,
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
 :  T3,
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
 :  T3,
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
 :  T3,
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.
 :  T3,
Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
 :  T3,
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
 :  T3,
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
 :  T3,
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
 :  T3,
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
 :  T3,
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
 :  T3,
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
 :  T3,
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
 :  T3,
more than the central fire.
 :  T3,
Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
 :  T3,
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
 :  T3,
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
 :  T3,
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
 :  T3,
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
 :  T3,
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
 :  T3,
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
 :  T3,
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
 :  T3,
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
 :  T3,
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.
 :  T3,
THE MOON
 :  T3,
Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
 :  T3,
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
 :  T3,
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
 :  T3,
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
 :  T3,
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
 :  T3,
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
 :  T3,
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.
 :  T3,
A Dead World
 :  T3,
The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
 :  T3,
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
 :  T3,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
 :  T3,
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
 :  T3,
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
 :  T3,
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
 :  T3,
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
 :  T3,
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
 :  T3,
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
 :  T3,
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
 :  T3,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
 :  T3,
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
 :  T3,
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
 :  T3,
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
 :  T3,
taking place on the moon. :  T3,

 :  T4,
But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
 :  T4,
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
 :  T4,
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
 :  T4,
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
 :  T4,
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
 :  T4,
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
 :  T4,
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
 :  T4,
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
 :  T4,
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
 :  T4,
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
 :  T4,
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
 :  T4,
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
 :  T4,
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
 :  T4,
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
 :  T4,
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
 :  T4,
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
 :  T4,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
 :  T4,
to vegetation.
 :  T4,
The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
 :  T4,
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
 :  T4,
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
 :  T4,
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
 :  T4,
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
 :  T4,
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
 :  T4,
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
 :  T4,
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
 :  T4,
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
 :  T4,
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
 :  T4,
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
 :  T4,
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
 :  T4,
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
 :  T4,
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
 :  T4,
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.

explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
 :  T4,
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
 :  T4,
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
 :  T4,
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
 :  T4,
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
 :  T4,
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
 :  T4,
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
 :  T4,
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
 :  T4,
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
 :  T4,
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
 :  T4,
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
 :  T4,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.
 :  T4,
The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
 :  T4,
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
 :  T4,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
 :  T4,
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
 :  T4,
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
 :  T4,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
 :  T4,
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."
 :  T4,
The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
 :  T4,
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
 :  T4,
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
 :  T4,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
 :  T4,
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
 :  T4,
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
 :  T4,
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.
 :  T4,
METEORS AND COMETS
 :  T4,
We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
 :  T4,
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
 :  T4,
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
 :  T4,
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
 :  T4,
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
 :  T4,
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
 :  T4,
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
 :  T4,
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
 :  T4,
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
 :  T4,
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.
 :  T4,
Millions of Meteorites
 :  T4,
It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
 :  T4,
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
 :  T4,
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
 :  T4,
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
 :  T4,
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.
 :  T4,
It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
 :  T4,
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
 :  T4,
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
 :  T4,
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
 :  T4,
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
 :  T4,
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
 :  T4,
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
 :  T4,
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
 :  T4,
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
 :  T4,
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
 :  T4,
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
 :  T4,
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
 :  T4,
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
 :  T4,
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
 :  T4,
always points away from the sun.
 :  T4,
A Great Comet
 :  T4,
The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
 :  T4,
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
 :  T4,
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
 :  T4,
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
 :  T4,
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
 :  T4,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
 :  T4,
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
 :  T4,
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
 :  T4,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
 :  T4,
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
 :  T4,
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

A wonderful cluster of stars. It has been estimated that the distance of

this cluster is such that it would take light more than 100,000 years to
 :  T4,
reach us.]
 :  T4,
THE STELLAR UNIVERSE
 :  T4,
The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
 :  T4,
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
 :  T4,
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
 :  T4,
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
 :  T4,
more than 300 times that of the sun.
 :  T4,
The Evolution of Stars
 :  T4,
The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
 :  T4,
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
 :  T4,
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
 :  T4,
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
 :  T4,
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
 :  T4,
that we call nebulæ.
 :  T4,
In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
 :  T4,
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
 :  T4,
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
 :  T4,
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
 :  T4,
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
 :  T4,
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
 :  T4,
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
 :  T4,
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
 :  T4,
themselves pass on their way to extinction.
 :  T4,
The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
 :  T4,
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
 :  T4,
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).
 :  T4,
The Age of Stars
 :  T4,
In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
 :  T4,
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
 :  T4,
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
 :  T4,
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
 :  T4,
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
 :  T4,
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
 :  T4,
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
 :  T4,
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
 :  T4,
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
 :  T4,
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
 :  T4,
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
 :  T4,
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
 :  T4,
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
 :  T4,
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
 :  T4,
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
 :  T4,
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
 :  T4,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
 :  T4,
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
 :  T4,
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
 :  T4,
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
 :  T4,
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
 :  T4,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
 :  T4,
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
 :  T4,
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
 :  T4,
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
 :  T4,
and precise answers.
 :  T4,
The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.
 :  T4,
THE NEBULAR THEORY
 :  T4,
Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
 :  T4,
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
 :  T4,
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
 :  T4,
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
 :  T4,
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
 :  T4,
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
 :  T4,
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
 :  T4,
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
 :  T4,
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
 :  T4,
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
 :  T4,
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
 :  T4,
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
 :  T4,
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.
 :  T4,
There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
 :  T4,
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
 :  T4,
we do not know.
 :  T4,
The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
 :  T4,
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
 :  T4,
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
 :  T4,
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
 :  T4,
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
 :  T4,
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
 :  T4,
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
 :  T4,
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
 :  T4,
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
 :  T4,
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
 :  T4,
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
 :  T4,
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
 :  T4,
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
 :  T4,
would seem to fit the case better.
 :  T4,
Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
 :  T4,
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
 :  T4,
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
 :  T4,
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
 :  T4,
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
 :  T4,
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
 :  T4,
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
 :  T4,
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
 :  T4,
condensation.
 :  T4,
Spiral Nebulæ
 :  T4,
It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
 :  T4,
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
 :  T4,
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
 :  T4,
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
 :  T4,
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
 :  T4,
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
 :  T4,
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
 :  T4,
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
 :  T4,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
 :  T4,
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
 :  T4,
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
 :  T4,
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
 :  T4,
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
 :  T4,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
 :  T4,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
 :  T4,
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
 :  T4,
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
 :  T4,
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
 :  T4,
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
 :  T4,
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
 :  T4,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
 :  T4,
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
 :  T4,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the

nucleus.] :  T4,
THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS
 :  T5,
Variable, New, and Dark Stars :  T5,
Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
 :  T5,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
 :  T5,
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
 :  T5,
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
 :  T5,
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
 :  T5,
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
 :  T5,
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
 :  T5,
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
 :  T5,
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
 :  T5,
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
 :  T5,
illumination would take place.
 :  T5,
One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
 :  T5,
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
 :  T5,
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
 :  T5,
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
 :  T5,
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
 :  T5,
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
 :  T5,
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
 :  T5,
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
 :  T5,
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
 :  T5,
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
 :  T5,
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
 :  T5,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
 :  T5,
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
 :  T5,
know their masses and their distances from each other.
 :  T5,
The Death and Birth of Stars
 :  T5,
We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
 :  T5,
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
 :  T5,
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
 :  T5,
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
 :  T5,
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
 :  T5,
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
 :  T5,
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
 :  T5,
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
 :  T5,
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
 :  T5,
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
 :  T5,
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
 :  T5,
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
 :  T5,
in the ether of space.
 :  T5,
The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
 :  T5,
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
 :  T5,
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
 :  T5,
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
 :  T5,
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
 :  T5,
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
 :  T5,
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
 :  T5,
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
 :  T5,
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
 :  T5,
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
 :  T5,
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
 :  T5,
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
 :  T5,
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
 :  T5,
in a few days.
 :  T5,
There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
 :  T5,
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
 :  T5,
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
 :  T5,
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
 :  T5,
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
 :  T5,
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
 :  T5,
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
 :  T5,
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
 :  T5,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
 :  T5,
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
 :  T5,
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
 :  T5,
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
 :  T5,
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
 :  T5,
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
 :  T5,
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
 :  T5,
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.
 :  T5,
But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
 :  T5,
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
 :  T5,
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
 :  T5,
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
 :  T5,
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
 :  T5,
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
 :  T5,
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
 :  T5,
second.
 :  T5, T9,
THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE
 :  T5,
§ 4
 :  T5, T6, T7, T8,
Our Universe a Spiral Nebula
 :  T5,
What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
 :  T5,
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
 :  T5,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
 :  T5,
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
 :  T5,
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
 :  T5,
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
 :  T5,
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
 :  T5,
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
 :  T5,
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
 :  T5,
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
 :  T5,
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
 :  T5,
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
 :  T5,
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
 :  T5,
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
 :  T5,
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
 :  T5,
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
 :  T5,
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
 :  T5,
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
 :  T5,
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
 :  T5,
angles to point to the north and south poles.
 :  T5,
Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
 :  T5,
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
 :  T5,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
 :  T5,
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
 :  T5,
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
 :  T5,
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
 :  T5,
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
 :  T5,
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
 :  T5,
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
 :  T5,
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
 :  T5,
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
 :  T5,
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
 :  T5,
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
 :  T5,
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
 :  T5,
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
 :  T5,
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
 :  T5,
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
 :  T5,
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
 :  T5,
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
 :  T5,
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
 :  T5,
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
 :  T5,
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
 :  T5,
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
 :  T5,
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
 :  T5,
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
 :  T5,
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
 :  T5,
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
 :  T5,
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
 :  T5,
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
 :  T5,
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
 :  T5,
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
 :  T5,
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
 :  T5,
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
 :  T5,
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
 :  T5,
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
 :  T5,
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
 :  T5,
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
 :  T5,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
 :  T5,
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
 :  T5,
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
 :  T5,
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
 :  T5,
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
 :  T5,
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
 :  T5,
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
 :  T5,
fabric of human knowledge.
 :  T5,
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
 :  T5,
The Telescope
 :  T5,
The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
 :  T5,
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
 :  T5,
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
 :  T5,
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
 :  T5,
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
 :  T5,
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.
 :  T5,
There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
 :  T5,
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
 :  T5,
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
 :  T5,
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
 :  T5,
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
 :  T5,
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
 :  T5,
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
 :  T5,
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
 :  T5,
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
 :  T5,
early instruments have only an historic interest :  T5,
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.
 :  T5,
During the last century telescope construction underwent an
 :  T5,
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
 :  T5,
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
 :  T5,
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
 :  T5,
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
 :  T5,
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
 :  T5,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
 :  T5,
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
 :  T5,
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
 :  T5,
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
 :  T5,
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
 :  T5,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
 :  T5,
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
 :  T5,
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
 :  T5,
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
 :  T5,
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
 :  T5,
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
 :  T5,
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
 :  T5,
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
 :  T5,
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
 :  T5,
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
 :  T5,
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
 :  T5,
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
 :  T5,
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
 :  T5,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.
 :  T5,
The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
 :  T5,
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
 :  T5,
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
 :  T5,
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
 :  T5,
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
 :  T5,
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
 :  T5,
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
 :  T5,
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
 :  T5,
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
 :  T5,
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
 :  T5,
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.
 :  T5,
(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
 :  T5,
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
 :  T5,
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.
 :  T5,
The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
 :  T5,
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
 :  T5,
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
 :  T5,
100 tons.
 :  T5,
The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
 :  T5,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
 :  T5,
about 35 tons.)]
 :  T5,
THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE
 :  T5,
The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
 :  T5,
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
 :  T5,
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
 :  T5,
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
 :  T5,
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]
 :  T5,
(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)
 :  T5,
The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
 :  T5,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]
 :  T5,
But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
 :  T5,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
 :  T5,
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
 :  T5,
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
 :  T5,
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
 :  T5,
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
 :  T5,
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
 :  T5,
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
 :  T5,
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
 :  T5,
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
 :  T5,
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
 :  T5,
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
 :  T5,
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
 :  T5,
telescopes.
 :  T5,
Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
 :  T5,
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
 :  T5,
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
 :  T5,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
 :  T5,
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
 :  T5,
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
 :  T5,
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
 :  T5,
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
 :  T5,
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
 :  T5,
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
 :  T5,
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
 :  T5,
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
 :  T5,
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
 :  T5,
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
 :  T5,
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
 :  T5,
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
 :  T5,
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
 :  T5,
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
 :  T5,
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
 :  T5,
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
 :  T5,
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
 :  T5,
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
 :  T5,
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
 :  T5,
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
 :  T5,
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.
 :  T5,
The Spectroscope
 :  T5,
We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
 :  T5,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
 :  T5,
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
 :  T5,
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
 :  T5,
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
 :  T5,
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
 :  T5,
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
 :  T5,
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
 :  T5,
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
 :  T5,
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
 :  T5,
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
 :  T5,
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
 :  T5,
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
 :  T5,
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
 :  T5,
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.
 :  T5,
Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
 :  T5,
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
 :  T5,
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
 :  T5,
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
 :  T5,
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
 :  T5,
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
 :  T5,
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
 :  T5,
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
 :  T5,
is a considerable loss of light.
 :  T5,
We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
 :  T5,
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
 :  T5,
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
 :  T5,
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
 :  T5,
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
 :  T5,
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
 :  T5,
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
 :  T5,
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
 :  T5,
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
 :  T5,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
 :  T5,
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
INTRODUCTORY
 :  T6,
THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
 :  T6,
CREATURES
 :  T6,
The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
 :  T6,
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
 :  T6,
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
 :  T6,
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
 :  T6,
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
 :  T6,
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
 :  T6,
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
 :  T6,
at work.
 :  T6,
The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
 :  T6,
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
 :  T6,
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
 :  T6,
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
 :  T6,
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
 :  T6,
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
 :  T6,
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
 :  T6,
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
 :  T6,
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
 :  T6,
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
 :  T6,
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
 :  T6,
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
 :  T6,
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
 :  T6,
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
 :  T6,
imagination.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
 :  T6,
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
 :  T6,
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
 :  T6,
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
 :  T6,
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
 :  T6,
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
 :  T6,
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
 :  T6,
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.
 :  T6,
Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
 :  T6,
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
 :  T6,
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
 :  T6,
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
 :  T6,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
 :  T6,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
 :  T6,
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
 :  T6,
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
 :  T6,
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
 :  T6,
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
 :  T6,
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
 :  T6,
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
 :  T6,
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.
 :  T6,
Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
 :  T6,
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
 :  T6,
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
 :  T6,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
 :  T6,
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
 :  T6,
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
 :  T6,
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
 :  T6,
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
 :  T6,
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
 :  T6,
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
 :  T6,
music.

 :  T6,
this estimate being very greatly increased.]

 :  T6,
The Beginning of the Earth
 :  T6,
When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
 :  T6,
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
 :  T6,
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
 :  T6,
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
 :  T6,
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
 :  T6,
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
 :  T6,
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
 :  T6,
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
 :  T6,
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
 :  T6,
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.
 :  T6,
The Nebular Hypothesis
 :  T6,
One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
 :  T6,
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
 :  T6,
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
 :  T6,
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
 :  T6,
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
 :  T6,
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
 :  T6,
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
 :  T6,
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
 :  T6,
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
 :  T6,
the sun.
 :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6,
Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
 :  T6,
before, with scientific caution :  T6,
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
 :  T6,
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
 :  T6,
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
 :  T6,
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
 :  T6,
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
 :  T6,
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
 :  T6,
into a planet.
 :  T6,
So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
 :  T6,
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
 :  T6,
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
 :  T6,
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
 :  T6,
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
 :  T6,
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
 :  T6,
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
 :  T6,
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
 :  T6,
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
 :  T6,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
 :  T6,
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
 :  T6,
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
 :  T6,
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
 :  T6,
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
 :  T6,
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
 :  T6,
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
 :  T6,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
 :  T6,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
 :  T6,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.
 :  T6,
Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
 :  T6,
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
 :  T6,
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
 :  T6,
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
 :  T6,
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
 :  T6,
subsequently fed.
 :  T6,
The Growth of the Earth
 :  T6,
It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
 :  T6,
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
 :  T6,
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
 :  T6,
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
 :  T6,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
 :  T6,
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
 :  T6,
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.
 :  T6,
A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
 :  T6,
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
 :  T6,
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
 :  T6,
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
 :  T6,
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
 :  T6,
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
 :  T6,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
 :  T6,
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
 :  T6,
oceans goes back to a very early stage.
 :  T6,
The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
 :  T6,
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
 :  T6,
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
 :  T6,
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
 :  T6,
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
 :  T6,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
 :  T6,
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
 :  T6,
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
 :  T6,
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
 :  T6,
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
 :  T6,
all.
 :  T6,
Making a Home for Life
 :  T6,
It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
 :  T6,
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
 :  T6,
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
 :  T6,
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
 :  T6,
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
 :  T6,
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
 :  T6,
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
 :  T6,
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
 :  T6,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
 :  T6,
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
 :  T6,
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
 :  T6,
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
 :  T6,
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
 :  T6,
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
 :  T6,
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
 :  T6,
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
 :  T6,
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
 :  T6,
80 per cent. of living matter itself.
 :  T6,
Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
 :  T6,
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
 :  T6,
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
 :  T6,
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
 :  T6,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
 :  T6,
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
 :  T6,
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
 :  T6,
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
 :  T6,
life.
 :  T1, T6, T7, T10,
Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth
 :  T6,
During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
 :  T6,
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
 :  T6,
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
 :  T6,
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
 :  T6,
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
 :  T6,
interesting to consider possibilities.

into which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents
 :  T6,
the present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]
 :  T6,
(Greatly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
 :  T6,
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
 :  T6,
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
 :  T6,
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
 :  T6,
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
 :  T6,
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
 :  T6,
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]
 :  T6,
From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
 :  T6,
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
 :  T6,
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
 :  T6,
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus" :  T6,
to say "Ignorabimus."
 :  T6,
A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
 :  T6,
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
 :  T6,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
 :  T6,
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
 :  T6,
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
 :  T6,
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
 :  T6,
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
 :  T6,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
 :  T6,
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
 :  T6,
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
 :  T6,
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
 :  T6,
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
 :  T6,
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
 :  T6,
elsewhere.
 :  T6,
The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
 :  T6,
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
 :  T6,
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
 :  T6,
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
 :  T6,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
 :  T6,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
 :  T6,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
 :  T6,
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
 :  T6,
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
 :  T6,
ones.
 :  T6,
Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
 :  T6,
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
 :  T6,
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
 :  T6,
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
 :  T6,
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
 :  T6,
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
 :  T6,
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
 :  T6,
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
 :  T6,
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
 :  T6,
true.
 :  T6,
If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
 :  T6,
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
 :  T6,
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
 :  T6,
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
 :  T6,
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
 :  T6,
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
 :  T6,
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
 :  T6,
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
 :  T6,
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
 :  T6,
and travailing becomes more intelligible.
 :  T6,
The First Organisms upon the Earth
 :  T6,
We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
 :  T6,
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
 :  T6,
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
 :  T6,
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
 :  T6,
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
 :  T6,
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
 :  T6,
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
 :  T6,
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
 :  T6,
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
 :  T6,
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
 :  T6,
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
 :  T6,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
 :  T6,
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
 :  T6,
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
 :  T6,
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
 :  T6,
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
 :  T6,
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
 :  T6,
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
 :  T6,
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
 :  T6,
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
 :  T6,
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
 :  T6,
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
 :  T6,
of the Vegetable Kingdom.
 :  T6,
On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
 :  T6,
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
 :  T6,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
 :  T6,
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
 :  T6,
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
 :  T6,
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
 :  T6,
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
 :  T6,
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
 :  T6,
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
 :  T6,
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
 :  T6,
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
 :  T6,
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
 :  T6,
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
 :  T6,
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.
 :  T6,
FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION
 :  T6,
THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
 :  T6,
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH
 :  T6,
The Contrast between Plants and Animals
 :  T6,
However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
 :  T6,
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
 :  T6,
the ways in the whole history of Nature.
 :  T6,
Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
 :  T6,
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
 :  T6,
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
 :  T6,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
 :  T6,
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
 :  T6,
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
 :  T6,
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
 :  T6,
keep them sluggish.
 :  T6,
Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
 :  T6,
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
 :  T6,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
 :  T6,
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
 :  T6,
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
 :  T6,
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
 :  T6,
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
 :  T6,
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
 :  T6,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
 :  T6,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
 :  T6,
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
 :  T6,
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
 :  T6,
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
 :  T6,
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

 :  T6,
As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
 :  T6,
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
 :  T6,
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
 :  T6,
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
 :  T6,
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
 :  T6,
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
 :  T6,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
 :  T6,
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
 :  T6,
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
 :  T6,
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
 :  T6,
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
 :  T6,
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
 :  T6,
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
 :  T6,
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
 :  T6,
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
 :  T6,
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
 :  T6,
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
 :  T6,
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
 :  T6,
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
 :  T6,
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.
 :  T6,
The Beginnings of Land Plants
 :  T6,
It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
 :  T6,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
 :  T6,
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
 :  T6,
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
 :  T6,
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
 :  T6,
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
 :  T6,
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
 :  T6,
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
 :  T6,
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
 :  T6,
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
 :  T6,
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
 :  T6,
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
 :  T6,
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
 :  T6,
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
 :  T6,
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.
 :  T6,
The Protozoa
 :  T6,
Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
 :  T6,
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
 :  T6,
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
 :  T6,
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
 :  T6,
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
 :  T6,
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
 :  T6,
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
 :  T6,
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
 :  T6,
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
 :  T6,
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
 :  T6,
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
 :  T6,
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
 :  T6,
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
 :  T6,
not gone in for body-making.
 :  T6,
In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
 :  T6,
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
 :  T6,
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
 :  T6,
Protozoa :  T6,
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
 :  T6,
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
 :  T6,
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
 :  T6,
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
 :  T6,
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
 :  T6,
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
 :  T6,
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
 :  T6,
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
 :  T6,
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
 :  T6,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
 :  T6,
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
 :  T6,
performing other useful offices.
 :  T6,
The Making of a Body
 :  T6,
The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
 :  T6,
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
 :  T6,
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
 :  T6,
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
 :  T6,
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
 :  T6,
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
 :  T6,
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.
 :  T6,
When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
 :  T6,
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
 :  T6,
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
 :  T6,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
 :  T6,
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
 :  T6,
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
 :  T6,
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
 :  T6,
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
 :  T6,
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
 :  T6,
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
 :  T6,
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
 :  T6,
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
 :  T6,
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
 :  T6,
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
 :  T6,
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
 :  T6,
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
 :  T6,
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.
 :  T6,
It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
 :  T6,
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
 :  T6,
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
 :  T6,
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
 :  T6,
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
 :  T6,
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
 :  T6,
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
 :  T6,
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
 :  T6,
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
 :  T6,
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
 :  T6,
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
 :  T6,
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
 :  T6,
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
 :  T6,
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
 :  T6,
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
 :  T6,
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
 :  T6,
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
 :  T6,
that made the first body possible.
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction
 :  T6,
A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
 :  T6,
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
 :  T6,
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
 :  T6,
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
 :  T6,
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
 :  T6,
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
 :  T6,
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
 :  T6,
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
 :  T6,
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
 :  T6,
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
 :  T6,
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
 :  T6,
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
 :  T6,
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
 :  T6,
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

TRYPANOSOMA GAMBIENSE
 :  T6,
(Very highly magnified.)
 :  T6,
The microscopic animal Trypanosome, which causes Sleeping Sickness. The
 :  T6,
study of these organisms has of late years acquired an immense
 :  T6,
importance on account of the widespread and dangerous maladies to which
 :  T6,
some of them give rise. It lives in the blood of man, who is infected by
 :  T6,
the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
 :  T6,
host.]
 :  T6,
The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
 :  T6,
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
 :  T6,
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
 :  T6,
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
 :  T6,
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
 :  T6,
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
 :  T6,
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]
 :  T6,
One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
 :  T6,
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
 :  T6,
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
 :  T6,
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
 :  T6,
animals, division of labour has begun.]
 :  T6,
Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
 :  T6,
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
 :  T6,
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
 :  T6,
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
 :  T6,
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
 :  T6,
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
 :  T6,
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
 :  T6,
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
 :  T6,
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
 :  T6,
sperm-cells.
 :  T6,
The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
 :  T6,
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
 :  T6,
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
 :  T6,
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
 :  T6,
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
 :  T6,
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
 :  T6,
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
 :  T6,
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
 :  T6,
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
 :  T6,
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
 :  T6,
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
 :  T6,
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
 :  T6,
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
 :  T6,
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.
 :  T6,
The Evolution of Sex
 :  T6,
Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
 :  T6,
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
 :  T6,
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
 :  T6,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
 :  T6,
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
 :  T6,
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
 :  T6,
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
 :  T6,
characters.
 :  T6,
In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
 :  T6,
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
 :  T6,
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
 :  T6,
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
 :  T6,
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
 :  T6,
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
 :  T6,
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
 :  T6,
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
 :  T6,
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
 :  T6,
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
 :  T6,
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
 :  T6,
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
 :  T6,
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
 :  T6,
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
 :  T6,
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
 :  T6,
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
 :  T6,
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
 :  T6,
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
 :  T6,
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
 :  T6,
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
 :  T6,
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.
 :  T6,
Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
 :  T6,
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
 :  T6,
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
 :  T6,
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.
 :  T6,
§ 5
 :  T6, T8,
What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
 :  T6,
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
 :  T6,
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
 :  T6,
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
 :  T6,
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
 :  T6,
stoppage of bodily life?
 :  T6,
The Beginning of Natural Death
 :  T6,
There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
 :  T6,
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
 :  T6,
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
 :  T6,
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
 :  T6,
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
 :  T6,
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
 :  T6,
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
 :  T6,
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
 :  T6,
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
 :  T6,
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
 :  T6,
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
 :  T6,
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
 :  T6,
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
 :  T6,
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
 :  T6,
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
 :  T6,
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
 :  T6,
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
 :  T6,
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
 :  T6,
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
 :  T6,
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
 :  T6,
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
 :  T6,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
 :  T6,
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
 :  T6,
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
 :  T6,
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
 :  T6,
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
 :  T6,
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
 :  T6,
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
 :  T6,
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
 :  T6,
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
 :  T6,
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
 :  T6,
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
 :  T6,
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
 :  T6,
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
 :  T6,
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
 :  T6,
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
 :  T6,
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
 :  T6,
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.
 :  T6,
Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
 :  T6,
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
 :  T6,
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
 :  T6,
life-history to suit various conditions.

 :  T6,
tentacles round the mouth. It is seen giving off a bud, a clear

 :  T6,
organism the latter is paralysed and drawn into the mouth.]
 :  T6,
EARTHWORM
 :  T6,
Earthworms began the profitable habit of moving with one end of the body
 :  T6,
always in front, and from worms to man the great majority of animals
 :  T6,
have bilateral symmetry.]

7. The chromosomes lie at the equator, and each is split longitudinally.
 :  T6,
The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
 :  T6,
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
 :  T6,
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.
 :  T6,
8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
 :  T6,
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

GLASS MODEL OF A SEA-ANEMONE
 :  T6,
A long tubular sea-anemone, with a fine crown of tentacles around the

 :  T6,
lassoes on the tentacles minute animals on which it feeds are paralysed
 :  T6,
and captured for food.]

TO MAN
 :  T6,
The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
 :  T6,
other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,
 :  T6,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
 :  T6,
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions
 :  T6,
In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
 :  T6,
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
 :  T6,
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
 :  T6,
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
 :  T6,
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
 :  T6,
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
 :  T6,
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
 :  T6,
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
 :  T6,
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
 :  T6,
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
 :  T6,
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
 :  T6,
to be found in some simple worm-types.
 :  T6,
Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice :  T6,
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
 :  T6,
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
 :  T6,
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
 :  T6,
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
 :  T6,
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
 :  T6,
which they also contribute.
 :  T6,
Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
 :  T6,
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
 :  T6,
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
 :  T6,
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
 :  T6,
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
 :  T6,
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
 :  T6,
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
 :  T6,
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
 :  T6,
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
 :  T6,
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
 :  T6,
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
 :  T6,
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
 :  T6,
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
 :  T6,
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.
 :  T6,
THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
 :  T6,
Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
 :  T6,
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
 :  T6,
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
 :  T6,
the evolution of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Evolution of Mind
 :  T6,
A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
 :  T6,
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
 :  T6,
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
 :  T6,
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
 :  T6,
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
 :  T6,
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
 :  T6,
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
 :  T6,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
 :  T6,
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
 :  T6,
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
 :  T6,
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
 :  T6,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
 :  T6,
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
 :  T6,
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
 :  T6,
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
 :  T6,
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
 :  T6,
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
 :  T6,
cannot put our finger on any point and say :  T6,
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
 :  T6,
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
 :  T6,
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
 :  T6,
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.
 :  T6,
The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
 :  T6,
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
 :  T6,
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
 :  T6,
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
 :  T6,
immemorial.]
 :  T6,
In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
 :  T6,
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
 :  T6,
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
 :  T6,
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
 :  T6,
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
 :  T6,
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
 :  T6,
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
 :  T6,
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
 :  T6,
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
 :  T6,
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
 :  T6,
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
 :  T6,
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
 :  T6,
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
 :  T6,
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
 :  T6,
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
 :  T6,
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
 :  T6,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
 :  T6,
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
 :  T6,
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
 :  T6,
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
 :  T6,
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
 :  T6,
individuality :  T6,
But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
 :  T6,
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
 :  T6,
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
 :  T6,
the shield :  T6,
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
 :  T6,
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
 :  T6,
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
 :  T6,
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
 :  T6,
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
 :  T6,
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
 :  T6,
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.
 :  T6,
The Trial and Error Method
 :  T6,
Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
 :  T6,
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
 :  T6,
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
 :  T6,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
 :  T6,
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
 :  T6,
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
 :  T6,
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
 :  T6,
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
 :  T6,
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
 :  T6,
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.
 :  T6,
It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
 :  T6,
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
 :  T6,
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
 :  T6,
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
 :  T6,
method, and a higher note is struck.
 :  T6,
There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
 :  T6,
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
 :  T6,
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.
 :  T6,
LIKE AN EARTHWORM

(SY^{2}) with the branches or dendrites of a motor nerve-cell (M.C.).
 :  T6,
6. An impulse or command travels along the motor nerve-fibre or axis
 :  T6,
cylinder of the motor nerve-cell.
 :  T6,
7. The motor nerve-fibre ends on a muscle-fibre (M.F.) near the surface.
 :  T6,
This moves and the reflex action is complete.]

THE YUCCA MOTH
 :  T6,
The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
 :  T6,
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
 :  T6,
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
 :  T6,
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
 :  T6,
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
 :  T6,
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
 :  T6,
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP

by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
 :  T6,
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
 :  T6,
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
 :  T6,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
 :  T6,
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an

Reflex Actions

Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the

beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
 :  T6,
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
 :  T6,
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
 :  T6,
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
 :  T6,
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
 :  T6,
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
 :  T6,
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
 :  T6,
What is it that happens?
 :  T6,
Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
 :  T6,
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
 :  T6,
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
 :  T6,
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
 :  T6,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
 :  T6,
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
 :  T6,
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
 :  T6,
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
 :  T6,
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
 :  T6,
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
 :  T6,
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
 :  T6,
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
 :  T6,
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
 :  T6,
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
 :  T6,
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
 :  T6,
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
 :  T6,
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
 :  T6,
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
 :  T6,
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
 :  T6,
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
 :  T6,
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
 :  T6,
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
 :  T6,
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
 :  T6,
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
 :  T6,
nervous system.
 :  T6,
What are Called Tropisms
 :  T6,
A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
 :  T6,
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
 :  T6,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
 :  T6,
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
 :  T6,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
 :  T6,
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
 :  T6,
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
 :  T6,
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
 :  T6,
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
 :  T6,
candle.
 :  T6,
It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
 :  T6,
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
 :  T6,
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
 :  T6,
in animal behaviour.
 :  T6,
Instinctive Behaviour
 :  T7,
On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
 :  T7,
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
 :  T7,
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
 :  T7,
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
 :  T7,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
 :  T7,
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
 :  T7,
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
 :  T7,
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
 :  T7,
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
 :  T7,
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
 :  T7,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
 :  T7,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
 :  T7,
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
 :  T7,
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
 :  T7,
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
 :  T7,
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
 :  T7,
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
 :  T7,
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
 :  T7,
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
 :  T7,
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
 :  T7,
form part of her instinctive repertory.
 :  T7,
From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
 :  T7,
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
 :  T7,
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
 :  T7,
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
 :  T7,
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
 :  T7,
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
 :  T7,
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
 :  T7,
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
 :  T7,
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
 :  T7,
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
 :  T7,
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
 :  T7,
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
 :  T7,
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
 :  T7,
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
 :  T7,
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
 :  T7,
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
 :  T7,
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
 :  T7,
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
 :  T7,
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
 :  T7,
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.
 :  T7,
Animal Intelligence
 :  T7,
The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
 :  T7,
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
 :  T7,
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
 :  T7,
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
 :  T7,
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
 :  T7,
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
 :  T7,
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
 :  T7,
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
 :  T7,
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
 :  T7,
awareness of relations.
 :  T7,
When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
 :  T7,
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
 :  T7,
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
 :  T7,
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
 :  T7,
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.
 :  T7,
Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
 :  T7,
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
 :  T7,
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
 :  T7,
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
 :  T7,
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
 :  T7,
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
 :  T7,
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
 :  T7,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.
 :  T7,
There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
 :  T7,
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
 :  T7,
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
 :  T7,
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
 :  T7,
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
 :  T7,
come to count for more and more.
 :  T7,
Evolution of Parental Care
 :  T7,
Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
 :  T7,
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
 :  T7,
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
 :  T7,
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
 :  T7,
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
 :  T7,
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
 :  T7,
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
 :  T7,
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
 :  T7,
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
 :  T7,
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.
 :  T7,
But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
 :  T7,
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
 :  T7,
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
 :  T7,
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
 :  T7,
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
 :  T7,
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
 :  T7,
evolution to which the animal has attained.
 :  T7,
Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
 :  T7,
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
 :  T7,
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
 :  T7,
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
 :  T7,
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
 :  T7,
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
 :  T7,
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
 :  T7,
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
 :  T7,
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.
 :  T7,
In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
 :  T7,
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
 :  T7,
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
 :  T7,
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
 :  T7,
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
 :  T7,
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
 :  T7,
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
 :  T7,
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
 :  T7,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
 :  T7,
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
 :  T7,
therefore a huge family.
 :  T7,
Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
 :  T7,
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
 :  T7,
climax among mammals.
 :  T7,
Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
 :  T7,
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
 :  T7,
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
 :  T7,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
 :  T7,
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
 :  T7,
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
 :  T7,
young.
 :  T7,
There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
 :  T7,
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
 :  T7,
progressive conquest of the environment.
 :  T7,
1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
 :  T7,
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
 :  T7,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
 :  T7,
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
 :  T7,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
 :  T7,
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
 :  T7,
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.
 :  T7,
The newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is
 :  T7,
enabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until
 :  T7,
such time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]

 :  T7,
PERIPATUS
 :  T7,
A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
 :  T7,
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
 :  T7,
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
 :  T7,
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
 :  T7,
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
 :  T7,
from its mouth.]
 :  T7,
ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH
 :  T7,
The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
 :  T7,
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
 :  T7,
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
 :  T7,
please.]
 :  T7,
It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
 :  T7,
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
 :  T7,
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.
 :  T7,
The Cradle of the Open Sea
 :  T7,
2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
 :  T7,
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.
 :  T7,
It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
 :  T7,
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
 :  T7,
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
 :  T7,
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
 :  T7,
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
 :  T7,
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
 :  T7,
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
 :  T7,
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
 :  T7,
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
 :  T7,
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
 :  T7,
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
 :  T7,
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
 :  T7,
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
 :  T7,
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
 :  T7,
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
 :  T7,
shore of the sea and the open sea.
 :  T7,
The Great Deeps
 :  T7,
3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
 :  T7,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
 :  T7,
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
 :  T7,
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
 :  T7,
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
 :  T7,
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
 :  T7,
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
 :  T7,
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
 :  T7,
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
 :  T7,
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
 :  T7,
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
 :  T7,
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
 :  T7,
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
 :  T7,
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
 :  T7,
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
 :  T7,
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
 :  T7,
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.
 :  T7,
The Freshwaters
 :  T7,
4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
 :  T7,
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
 :  T7,
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
 :  T7,
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
 :  T7,
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
 :  T7,
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
 :  T7,
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
 :  T7,
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
 :  T7,
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
 :  T7,
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.
 :  T7,
Conquest of the Dry Land
 :  T7,
5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
 :  T7,
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
 :  T7,
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
 :  T7,
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
 :  T7,
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
 :  T7,
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
 :  T7,
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
 :  T7,
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
 :  T7,
possess the dry land.
 :  T7,
Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.
 :  T7,
It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
 :  T7,
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
 :  T7,
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
 :  T7,
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
 :  T7,
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
 :  T7,
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
 :  T7,
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
 :  T7,
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
 :  T7,
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
 :  T7,
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
 :  T7,
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
 :  T7,
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
 :  T7,
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.
 :  T7,
The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
 :  T7,
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
 :  T7,
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
 :  T7,
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
 :  T7,
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
 :  T7,
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
 :  T7,
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
 :  T7,
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
 :  T7,
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
 :  T7,
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
 :  T7,
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
 :  T7,
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
 :  T7,
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.
 :  T7,
Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life
 :  T7,
A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
 :  T7,
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
 :  T7,
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
 :  T7,
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
 :  T7,
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
 :  T7,
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
 :  T7,
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
 :  T7,
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
 :  T7,
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
 :  T7,
sea.
 :  T6, T7, T10,
Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
 :  T7,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
 :  T7,
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
 :  T7,
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
 :  T7,
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
 :  T7,
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
 :  T7,
retreat.
 :  T7,
Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
 :  T7,
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
 :  T7,
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
 :  T7,
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
 :  T7,
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
 :  T7,
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
 :  T7,
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
 :  T7,
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
 :  T7,
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
 :  T7,
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
 :  T7,
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
 :  T7,
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.

PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)
 :  T7,
One of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a
 :  T7,
teacher and expositor. He did great service in gaining a place for
 :  T7,
science in ordinary education and in popular estimation. No one

championed Evolutionism with more courage and skill.]

One of the founders of modern Comparative Anatomy. A man of gigantic
 :  T7,
intellect, who came to Paris as a youth from the provinces, and became
 :  T7,
the director of the higher education of France and a peer of the Empire.
 :  T7,
He was opposed to Evolutionist ideas, but he had anatomical genius.]

SWOOPING

Gull, with a feather-wing, a true flier. Fox-bat, with a skin-wing, a
 :  T7,
true flier. Flying Squirrel, with a parachute of skin, able to swoop
 :  T7,
from tree to tree, but not to fly. Flying Fish, with pectoral fins used
 :  T7,
as volplanes in a great leap due to the tail. To some extent able to
 :  T7,
sail in albatros fashion.]
 :  T7,
Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
 :  T7,
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
 :  T7,
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
 :  T7,
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
 :  T7,
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
 :  T7,
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
 :  T7,
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
 :  T7,
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
 :  T7,
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
 :  T7,
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
 :  T7,
progress.
 :  T1, T7,
Conquering the Air
 :  T7,
6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
 :  T7,
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
 :  T7,
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
 :  T7,
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
 :  T7,
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
 :  T7,
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
 :  T7,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
 :  T7,
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
 :  T7,
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
 :  T7,
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
 :  T7,
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
 :  T7,
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
 :  T7,
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
 :  T7,
own.
 :  T1, T7, T10,
The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
 :  T7,
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
 :  T7,
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
 :  T7,
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
 :  T7,
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
 :  T7,
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
 :  T7,
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
 :  T7,
stand alone.

THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES
 :  T7,
The Rock Record
 :  T7,
How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
 :  T7,
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
 :  T7,
and the succession of their advances? The answer is :  T7,
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
 :  T7,
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
 :  T7,
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
 :  T7,
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
 :  T7,
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
 :  T7,
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
 :  T7,
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
 :  T7,
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
 :  T7,
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
 :  T7,
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
 :  T7,
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
 :  T7,
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.
 :  T7,
The Use of Fossils
 :  T7,
When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
 :  T7,
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
 :  T7,
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
 :  T7,
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
 :  T7,
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
 :  T7,
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
 :  T7,
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
 :  T7,
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
 :  T7,
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
 :  T7,
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
 :  T7,
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
 :  T7,
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
 :  T7,
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
 :  T7,
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
 :  T7,
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
 :  T7,
clearly worked out.
 :  T7,
If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
 :  T7,
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
 :  T7,
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
 :  T7,
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
 :  T7,
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
 :  T7,
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.
 :  T7,
The Geological Time-table
 :  T7,
The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
 :  T7,
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
 :  T7,
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
 :  T7,
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.
 :  T7,
Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
 :  T7,
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
 :  T7,
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
 :  T7,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
 :  T7,
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
 :  T7,
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
 :  T7,
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
 :  T7,
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
 :  T7,
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
 :  T7,
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
 :  T7,
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
 :  T7,
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
 :  T7,
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
 :  T7,
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
 :  T7,
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
 :  T7,
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
 :  T7,
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
 :  T7,
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
 :  T7,
certainty has been reached.
 :  T7,
The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
 :  T7,
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
 :  T7,
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
 :  T7,
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
 :  T7,
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
 :  T7,
total of sixty millions.
 :  T7,
The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks
 :  T7,
It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
 :  T7,
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
 :  T7,
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
 :  T7,
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
 :  T7,
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
 :  T7,
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
 :  T7,
creatures the rock record tells us little.
 :  T7,
ANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,
 :  T7,
Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]
 :  T7,
A TRILOBITE
 :  T7,
Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
 :  T7,
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
 :  T7,
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
 :  T7,
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
 :  T7,
their ring-armour.]
 :  T7,
THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS
 :  T7,
It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
 :  T7,
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
 :  T7,
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
 :  T7,
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
 :  T7,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
 :  T7,
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
 :  T7,
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
 :  T7,
liberated were quite lively.]
 :  T7,
(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)
 :  T7,
A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
 :  T7,
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
 :  T7,
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
 :  T7,
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]
 :  T7,
The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
 :  T7,
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
 :  T7,
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
 :  T7,
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]
 :  T7,
The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
 :  T7,
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
 :  T7,
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
 :  T7,
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
 :  T7,
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
 :  T7,
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
 :  T7,
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
 :  T7,
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
 :  T7,
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
 :  T7,
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
 :  T7,
flourished in these ancient days.
 :  T7,
The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)
 :  T7,
The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
 :  T7,
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
 :  T7,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
 :  T7,
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
 :  T7,
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
 :  T7,
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
 :  T7,
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.
 :  T7,
The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
 :  T7,
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
 :  T7,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
 :  T7,
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
 :  T7,
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
 :  T7,
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
 :  T7,
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
 :  T7,
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
 :  T7,
in dominating the seas.

 :  T7,
In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
 :  T7,
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
 :  T7,
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
 :  T7,
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
 :  T7,
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
 :  T7,
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
 :  T7,
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
 :  T7,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
 :  T7,
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
 :  T7,
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
 :  T7,
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
 :  T7,
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
 :  T7,
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
 :  T7,
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
 :  T7,
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
 :  T7,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.
 :  T7,
EARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS
 :  T7,
E.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal
 :  T7,
in the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant
 :  T7,
Reptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with
 :  T7,
progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]
 :  T7,
The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
 :  T7,
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
 :  T7,
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
 :  T7,
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
 :  T7,
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
 :  T7,
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
 :  T7,
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
 :  T7,
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
 :  T7,
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
 :  T7,
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
 :  T7,
the Devonian seas.
 :  T7,
EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS
 :  T7,
Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures
 :  T7,
The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
 :  T7,
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
 :  T7,
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
 :  T7,
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
 :  T7,
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
 :  T7,
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
 :  T7,
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
 :  T7,
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
 :  T7,
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
 :  T7,
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
 :  T7,
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
 :  T7,
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
 :  T7,
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
 :  T7,
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
 :  T7,
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
 :  T7,
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
 :  T7,
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
 :  T7,
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
 :  T7,
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
 :  T7,
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
 :  T7,
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
 :  T7,
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
 :  T7,
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
 :  T7,
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
 :  T7,
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
 :  T7,
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
 :  T7,
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
 :  T7,
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
 :  T7,
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!
 :  T7,
The Acquisitions of Amphibians.
 :  T7,
As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
 :  T7,
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
 :  T7,
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
 :  T7,
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
 :  T7,
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
 :  T7,
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
 :  T7,
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
 :  T7,
must be :  T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10,
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
 :  T7,
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
 :  T7,
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
 :  T7,
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
 :  T7,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
 :  T7,
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
 :  T7,
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
 :  T7,
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
 :  T7,
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
 :  T7,
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
 :  T7,
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
 :  T7,
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
 :  T7,
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
 :  T7,
following :  T2, T5, T7, T10,
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
 :  T7,
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
 :  T7,
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
 :  T7,
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
 :  T7,
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
 :  T7,
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
 :  T7,
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
 :  T7,
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
 :  T7,
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
 :  T7,
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
 :  T7,
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
 :  T7,
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
 :  T7,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
 :  T7,
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
 :  T7,
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
 :  T7,
one of the great steps in organic evolution.
 :  T7,
FOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON
 :  T7,
The wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated
 :  T7,
outermost finger. The long tail served for balancing and steering. The
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls varied from the size of sparrows to a wing-span of fifteen
 :  T7,
feet--the largest flying creatures.]
 :  T7,
Total length about 9 feet. (Remains found in Cape Colony, South
 :  T7,
Africa.)]
 :  T7,
(From remains found in Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, U.S.A.)
 :  T7,
This Dinosaur, about the size of a large rhinoceros, had a huge
 :  T7,
three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
 :  T7,
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
 :  T7,
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
 :  T7,
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]
 :  T7,
THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA
 :  T7,
The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
 :  T7,
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
 :  T7,
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
 :  T7,
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
 :  T7,
also burrow.]
 :  T7,
Evolution of the Voice
 :  T7,
The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
 :  T7,
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
 :  T7,
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
 :  T7,
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
 :  T7,
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
 :  T7,
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
 :  T7,
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
 :  T7,
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
 :  T7,
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
 :  T7,
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
 :  T7,
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
 :  T7,
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
 :  T7,
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
 :  T7,
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
 :  T7,
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.
 :  T7,
The Early Reptiles
 :  T7,
In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
 :  T7,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
 :  T7,
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
 :  T7,
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
 :  T7,
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
 :  T7,
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
 :  T7,
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
 :  T7,
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
 :  T7,
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
 :  T7,
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
 :  T7,
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
 :  T7,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
 :  T7,
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
 :  T7,
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
 :  T7,
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
 :  T7,
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
 :  T7,
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).
 :  T7,
It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
 :  T7,
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
 :  T7,
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
 :  T7,
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
 :  T7,
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
 :  T7,
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
 :  T7,
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
 :  T7,
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
 :  T7,
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
 :  T7,
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
 :  T7,
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
 :  T7,
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
 :  T7,
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
 :  T7,
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!
 :  T7,
In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
 :  T7,
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
 :  T7,
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
 :  T7,
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
 :  T7,
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
 :  T7,
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
 :  T7,
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
 :  T7,
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
 :  T7,
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
 :  T7,
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
 :  T7,
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
 :  T7,
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
 :  T7,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
 :  T7,
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
 :  T7,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
 :  T7,
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
 :  T7,
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.
 :  T7,
Disappearance of many Ancient Types
 :  T7,
We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
 :  T7,
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
 :  T7,
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
 :  T7,
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
 :  T7,
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
 :  T7,
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
 :  T7,
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
 :  T7,
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
 :  T7,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
 :  T7,
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
 :  T7,
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
 :  T7,
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
 :  T7,
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
 :  T7,
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
 :  T7,
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
 :  T7,
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
 :  T7,
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
 :  T7,
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
 :  T7,
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
 :  T7,
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
 :  T7,
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
 :  T7,
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
 :  T7,
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
 :  T7,
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
 :  T7,
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
 :  T7,
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
 :  T7,
reptiles and a new flora.
 :  T7,
THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES
 :  T7,
The Mesozoic Era
 :  T7,
In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
 :  T7,
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
 :  T7,
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
 :  T7,
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
 :  T7,
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.
 :  T7,
In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
 :  T7,
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
 :  T7,
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
 :  T7,
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
 :  T7,
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
 :  T7,
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
 :  T7,
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
 :  T7,
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
 :  T7,
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
 :  T7,
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
 :  T7,
climax of creation.
 :  T7,
The Flying Dragons
 :  T7,
The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
 :  T7,
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
 :  T7,
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
 :  T7,
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
 :  T7,
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
 :  T7,
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
 :  T7,
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
 :  T7,
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
 :  T7,
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
 :  T7,
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
 :  T7,
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
 :  T7,
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
 :  T7,
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
 :  T7,
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
 :  T7,
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
 :  T7,
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
 :  T7,
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
 :  T7,
back."
 :  T7,
The First Known Bird
 :  T7,
But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
 :  T7,
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
 :  T7,
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
 :  T7,
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
 :  T7,
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
 :  T7,
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
 :  T7,
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
 :  T7,
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
 :  T7,
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
 :  T7,
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
 :  T7,
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
 :  T7,
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
 :  T7,
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
 :  T7,
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
 :  T7,
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
 :  T7,
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
 :  T7,
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
 :  T7,
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
 :  T7,
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration :  T7,
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh._)
 :  T7,
The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
 :  T7,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
 :  T7,
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
 :  T7,
type.]

 :  T7,

 :  T7,
There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
 :  T7,
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
 :  T7,
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
 :  T7,
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
 :  T7,
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
 :  T7,
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
 :  T7,
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
 :  T7,
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
 :  T7,
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
 :  T7,
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
 :  T7,
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
 :  T7,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
 :  T7,
on entirely different lines.
 :  T7,
In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
 :  T7,
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
 :  T7,
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
 :  T7,
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
 :  T7,
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
 :  T7,
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
 :  T7,
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
 :  T7,
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
 :  T7,
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
 :  T7,
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
 :  T7,
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
 :  T7,
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
 :  T7,
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
 :  T7,
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.
 :  T7,
There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
 :  T7,
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
 :  T7,
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
 :  T7,
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
 :  T7,
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
 :  T7,
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
 :  T7,
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
 :  T7,
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
 :  T7,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
 :  T7,
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
 :  T7,
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
 :  T7,
before mammals did.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
 :  T7,
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence :  T7,
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
 :  T7,
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
 :  T7,
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."
 :  T7,
The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era
 :  T7,
In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
 :  T7,
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
 :  T7,
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
 :  T7,
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
 :  T7,
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
 :  T7,
richer evolution of insects and birds.
 :  T7,
During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
 :  T7,
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.
 :  T7,
The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
 :  T7,
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
 :  T7,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
 :  T7,
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
 :  T7,
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
 :  T7,
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
 :  T7,
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
 :  T7,
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
 :  T7,
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
 :  T7,
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
 :  T7,
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
 :  T7,
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
 :  T7,
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
 :  T7,
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
 :  T7,
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
 :  T7,
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
 :  T7,
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
 :  T7,
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
 :  T7,
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.
 :  T7,
The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
 :  T7,
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
 :  T7,
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
 :  T7,
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
 :  T7,
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
 :  T7,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
 :  T7,
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
 :  T7,
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
 :  T7,
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."
 :  T7,
The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
 :  T7,
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
 :  T7,
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
 :  T7,
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
 :  T7,
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
 :  T7,
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
 :  T7,
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
 :  T7,
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
 :  T7,
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
 :  T7,
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
 :  T7,
migration.
 :  T7,
Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again :  T7,
    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
 :  T7,
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
 :  T7,
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
 :  T7,
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
 :  T7,
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
 :  T7,
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
 :  T7,
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
 :  T7,
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
 :  T7,
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
 :  T7,
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
 :  T7,
    brute associates."
 :  T7,
In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.
 :  T7,
The Ascent of Man
 :  T7,
Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
 :  T7,
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
 :  T7,
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
 :  T7,
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
 :  T7,
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
 :  T7,
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
 :  T7,
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
 :  T7,
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
 :  T7,
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
 :  T7,
he is "a social person."
 :  T7,
Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
 :  T7,
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
 :  T7,
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
 :  T7,
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
 :  T7,
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.
 :  T7,
FORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,
 :  T7,
BEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND
 :  T7,
CULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY
 :  T7,
(_After Marsh and Lull._)
 :  T7,
1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3
 :  T7,
and 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and
 :  T7,
6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse. Note how the toes shorten and
 :  T7,
disappear.]
 :  T7,
WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
 :  T7,
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT
 :  T7,
This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
 :  T7,
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
 :  T7,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
 :  T7,
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
 :  T7,
and then the fingers.]
 :  T7,
But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
 :  T7,
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
 :  T7,
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
 :  T7,
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
 :  T7,
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
 :  T7,
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
 :  T7,
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
 :  T7,
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
 :  T7,
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
 :  T7,
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.
 :  T7,
It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
 :  T7,
Darwin's _Descent of Man_ :  T7,
    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
 :  T7,
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
 :  T7,
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
 :  T7,
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
 :  T7,
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
 :  T7,
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
 :  T7,
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."
 :  T7,
THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE
 :  T7,
There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
 :  T7,
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
 :  T7,
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
 :  T7,
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
 :  T7,
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
 :  T7,
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
 :  T7,
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
 :  T7,
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
 :  T7,
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
 :  T7,
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
 :  T7,
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
 :  T7,
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
 :  T7,
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
 :  T7,
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
 :  T7,
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
 :  T7,
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
 :  T7,
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
 :  T7,
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
 :  T7,
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
 :  T7,
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
 :  T7,
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
 :  T7,
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
 :  T7,
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
 :  T7,
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
 :  T7,
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
 :  T7,
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
 :  T7,
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
 :  T7,
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
 :  T7,
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
Parasitism
 :  T7,
It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
 :  T7,
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
 :  T7,
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
 :  T7,
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
 :  T7,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
 :  T7,
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
 :  T7,
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
 :  T7,
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
 :  T7,
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
 :  T7,
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.
 :  T7,
This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
 :  T7,
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
 :  T7,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
 :  T7,
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
 :  T7,
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
 :  T7,
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
 :  T7,
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
 :  T7,
"beasts of prey" working from within.
 :  T7,
But there are two sides to this minor chapter :  T7,
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
 :  T7,
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
 :  T7,
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
 :  T7,
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
 :  T7,
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
 :  T7,
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
 :  T7,
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.
 :  T7,
THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT
 :  T7,
Progress in Evolution
 :  T7,
There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
 :  T7,
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
 :  T7,
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
 :  T7,
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
 :  T7,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
 :  T7,
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
 :  T7,
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
 :  T7,
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
 :  T7,
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
 :  T7,
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
 :  T7,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
 :  T7,
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
 :  T7,
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
 :  T7,
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
 :  T7,
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.
 :  T7,
Evidences of Evolution
 :  T7,
In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
 :  T7,
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
 :  T7,
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
 :  T7,
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
 :  T7,
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
 :  T7,
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
 :  T7,
that it does not open.
 :  T7,
But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
 :  T7,
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
 :  T7,
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
 :  T7,
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
 :  T7,
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
 :  T7,
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
 :  T7,
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
 :  T7,
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
 :  T7,
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
 :  T7,
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?
 :  T7,
There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
 :  T7,
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
 :  T7,
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
 :  T7,
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
 :  T7,
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
 :  T7,
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
 :  T7,
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
 :  T7,
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
 :  T7,
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.
 :  T7,
There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
 :  T7,
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
 :  T7,
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
 :  T7,
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
 :  T7,
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
 :  T7,
change need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has
 :  T7,
been secured.
 :  T7,
There is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the
 :  T7,
fore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing
 :  T7,
of a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm
 :  T7,
of a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse
 :  T7,
results! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two
 :  T7,
sets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is
 :  T7,
there any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which
 :  T7,
ancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified
 :  T7,
by the way in which it works.
 :  T7,
Factors in Evolution
 :  T7,
If it be said "So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the
 :  T7,
_factors_?" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the
 :  T7,
greatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very
 :  T7,
young. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the
 :  T7,
publication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.
 :  T7,
Heritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and
 :  T7,
these form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the
 :  T7,
outcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into
 :  T7,
organisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the
 :  T7,
germ-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and
 :  T7,
inherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a
 :  T7,
multitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be
 :  T7,
reshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very
 :  T7,
changeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the
 :  T7,
sea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such
 :  T7,
as change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its
 :  T7,
germ-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the
 :  T7,
wearisome reiteration of "perhaps." Moreover, every many-celled organism
 :  T7,
reproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a
 :  T7,
sperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this
 :  T7,
fertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living
 :  T7,
items and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is
 :  T7,
something like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As
 :  T7,
to the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities
 :  T7,
in nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are
 :  T7,
often very important for the individual, but it does not follow that
 :  T7,
they are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that
 :  T7,
they are transmissible.
 :  T7,
Given a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the
 :  T7,
inborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are
 :  T7,
sifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less
 :  T7,
fit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in
 :  T7,
many different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The
 :  T7,
organism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences
 :  T7,
may determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions
 :  T7,
will tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to
 :  T7,
survive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps
 :  T7,
increased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of
 :  T7,
sifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the
 :  T7,
species. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of
 :  T7,
"isolation" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members
 :  T7,
of a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar
 :  T7,
forms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends
 :  T7,
to promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to
 :  T7,
suggest the general method of organic evolution :  T7,
organisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying
 :  T7,
magnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of
 :  T7,
testing all things and holding fast that which is good.

The Reptilian Mind
 :  T8,
We speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to
 :  T8,
justify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,
 :  T8,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much
 :  T8,
more than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a
 :  T8,
tiny rill.
 :  T8,
No doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive
 :  T8,
rather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known "soft-shell"
 :  T8,
tortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so
 :  T8,
quickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for
 :  T8,
crayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud
 :  T8,
when cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into
 :  T8,
the water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the
 :  T8,
warm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for
 :  T8,
egg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All
 :  T8,
is effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of
 :  T8,
other reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of
 :  T8,
instinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency
 :  T8,
and endeavour.
 :  T8,
In a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to
 :  T8,
their homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is
 :  T8,
indubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise :  T8,
old lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,
 :  T8,
it always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while
 :  T8,
to strangers it was altogether inattentive." Of definite learning there
 :  T8,
are a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of
 :  T8,
retiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface
 :  T8,
itself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a
 :  T8,
simple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about
 :  T8,
constantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the
 :  T8,
maze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen
 :  T8,
minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five
 :  T8,
minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was
 :  T8,
less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five
 :  T8,
seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,
 :  T8,
the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,
 :  T8,
which only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did
 :  T8,
not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning
 :  T8,
from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of
 :  T8,
animal behaviour.
 :  T6, T8,
Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased
 :  T8,
masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records
 :  T8,
of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of
 :  T8,
feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can
 :  T8,
be accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.
 :  T8,
The error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of
 :  T8,
intelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure
 :  T8,
adaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly
 :  T8,
seized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which
 :  T8,
breaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a
 :  T8,
reflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger
 :  T8,
from a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the
 :  T8,
egg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against
 :  T8,
downward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious
 :  T8,
contents is lost and the broken "empties" are returned. It is admirable,
 :  T8,
indeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.
 :  T8,
Mind in Birds
 :  T8,
Sight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides
 :  T8,
pulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials
 :  T8,
for intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in
 :  T8,
the old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect
 :  T8,
which was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the
 :  T8,
certainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit
 :  T8,
from the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In
 :  T8,
their power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are
 :  T8,
unsurpassed.
 :  T8,
To the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good
 :  T8,
second. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of
 :  T8,
the bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,
 :  T8,
respond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the
 :  T8,
parents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such
 :  T8,
as the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.
 :  T8,
They do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying
 :  T8,
the living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is
 :  T8,
instinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the
 :  T8,
sense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.
 :  T8,
It is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the
 :  T8,
part of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a
 :  T8,
cultivated ear.
 :  T8,
The beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself
 :  T8,
more trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the
 :  T8,
trunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that
 :  T8,
the autumn gales will do the rest.]
 :  T8,
THE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL
 :  T8,
The song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it
 :  T8,
against a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.
 :  T8,
Many broken shells are often found around the anvil.]
 :  T8,
As to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the
 :  T8,
bill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe
 :  T8,
for unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly
 :  T8,
developed, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an
 :  T8,
emphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.
 :  T8,
Of smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present
 :  T8,
in certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain
 :  T8,
that it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the
 :  T8,
carcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually
 :  T8,
credited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen
 :  T8,
gland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the
 :  T8,
recognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.
 :  T8,
There may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a
 :  T8,
sense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to
 :  T8,
demonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by
 :  T8,
students of bird migration in order to "explain" how the birds find
 :  T8,
their way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open
 :  T8,
gateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.
 :  T8,
Instinctive Aptitudes
 :  T8,
Many a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is
 :  T8,
tumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any
 :  T8,
learning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit
 :  T8,
by, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds
 :  T8,
seem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities--limited when compared with the "little-brained" ants and
 :  T8,
bees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made
 :  T8,
cleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means
 :  T8,
that intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the
 :  T8,
reins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan
 :  T8,
observed that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no
 :  T8,
instinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when
 :  T8,
she was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink
 :  T8,
from a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,
 :  T8,
even when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to
 :  T8,
peck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as
 :  T8,
the stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or
 :  T8,
twice they actually stuffed their crops with "worms" of red worsted!
 :  T8,
Instinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more
 :  T8,
limited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in
 :  T8,
the fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray
 :  T8,
Lankester has called "educability." Young birds _learn_ with prodigious
 :  T8,
rapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary
 :  T8,
obligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted
 :  T8,
mistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to
 :  T8,
profit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures
 :  T8,
of the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to
 :  T8,
profit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such
 :  T8,
hard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the
 :  T8,
enregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the
 :  T8,
occasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.
 :  T8,
Nor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of
 :  T8,
engrained instinctive obligations, and can always "ring up" intelligence
 :  T8,
in a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a
 :  T8,
pigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded
 :  T8,
only a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines
 :  T8,
birds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.
 :  T8,
The peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet
 :  T8,
a notable power of learning intelligently.
 :  T8,
Intelligence co-operating with Instinct
 :  T8,
Professor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up
 :  T8,
in isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would
 :  T8,
not dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one
 :  T8,
day when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire
 :  T8,
stream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward
 :  T8,
feint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared
 :  T8,
from view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above
 :  T8,
the water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird
 :  T8,
had dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.
 :  T8,
There can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The
 :  T8,
moorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and
 :  T8,
diving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the
 :  T8,
former. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months
 :  T8,
of swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the
 :  T8,
course of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving
 :  T8,
capacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it
 :  T8,
was emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently
 :  T8,
appreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated
 :  T8,
with instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.
 :  T8,
Birds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,
 :  T8,
scratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,
 :  T8,
nest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more
 :  T8,
purely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual
 :  T8,
"nurture" seems to mingle with the inherited "nature." The two together
 :  T8,
result in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After
 :  T8,
Lloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable
 :  T8,
caterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early
 :  T8,
days with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between
 :  T8,
the "big-brain" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive
 :  T8,
capacities, but eminently "educable," and the "little-brain" type, say,
 :  T8,
of ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very
 :  T8,
far from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to
 :  T8,
have made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on
 :  T8,
different tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against
 :  T8,
one another. The "little-brain" type makes for a climax in the ant,
 :  T8,
where instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the
 :  T8,
"big-brain" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and
 :  T8,
monkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds
 :  T8,
is in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of
 :  T8,
intelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest
 :  T8,
out of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly
 :  T8,
seen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,
 :  T8,
which attacks the sheep in New Zealand.
 :  T8,
Some young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at
 :  T8,
the seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined
 :  T8,
hereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their
 :  T8,
young ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and
 :  T8,
then intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores
 :  T8,
of cases.
 :  T8,
Using their Wits
 :  T8,
When the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it
 :  T8,
fall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh
 :  T8,
exposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it
 :  T8,
discovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,
 :  T8,
as is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way
 :  T8,
herring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them
 :  T8,
fall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks
 :  T8,
deal with freshwater mussels.
 :  T8,
The Thrush's Anvil
 :  T8,
A very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it
 :  T8,
takes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its
 :  T8,
so-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,
 :  T8,
Miss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in
 :  T8,
them until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then
 :  T8,
pecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature
 :  T8,
retreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over
 :  T8,
again, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It
 :  T8,
pecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real
 :  T8,
progress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail
 :  T8,
and beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it
 :  T8,
picked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying
 :  T8,
first one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the
 :  T8,
thrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain
 :  T8,
predisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but
 :  T8,
the experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an
 :  T8,
untutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a
 :  T8,
difficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this
 :  T8,
might be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is
 :  T8,
useful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether
 :  T8,
imitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.
 :  T8,
The Mind of the Mammal
 :  T8,
When we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant
 :  T8,
helping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,
 :  T8,
we are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we
 :  T8,
have just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the
 :  T8,
animal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we
 :  T8,
are apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of
 :  T8,
mammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying
 :  T8,
effect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep
 :  T8,
contrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to
 :  T8,
form a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend
 :  T8,
too much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those
 :  T8,
whose mental life has been dulled by domestication.

What is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a
 :  T8,
tree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to
 :  T8,
snap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?
 :  T8,
What is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the
 :  T8,
squirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces
 :  T8,
of behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn
 :  T8,
predispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they
 :  T8,
seem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,
 :  T8,
saving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of
 :  T8,
ants and bees.
 :  T8,
Sheer Dexterity
 :  T8,
Besides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal
 :  T8,
perfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired
 :  T8,
dexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also
 :  T8,
marked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any
 :  T8,
rigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the
 :  T8,
Jumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred
 :  T8,
river-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that
 :  T8,
their smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the
 :  T8,
river. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys
 :  T8,
(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps
 :  T8,
secure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a
 :  T8,
footing on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer
 :  T8,
dexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to
 :  T8,
experiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new
 :  T8,
departures in behaviour.

THE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER
 :  T9,
The Structure of the Atom
 :  T9,
There is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and
 :  T9,
mathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know
 :  T9,
that the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under
 :  T9,
stimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and
 :  T9,
they therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the
 :  T9,
independent existence of atoms and also of electrons.
 :  T9,
When, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons
 :  T9,
compose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult
 :  T9,
speculation. Take the letter "o" as it is printed on this page. In a
 :  T9,
little bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are
 :  T9,
_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are
 :  T9,
circulating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the
 :  T9,
physicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still
 :  T9,
smaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental
 :  T9,
pictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and
 :  T9,
discards when they will _not_ fit.
 :  T9,
At present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are
 :  T9,
two chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.
 :  T9,
Thomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of
 :  T9,
an onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.
 :  T9,
Rutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated
 :  T9,
round a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving
 :  T9,
round the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the
 :  T9,
electrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of
 :  T9,
electricity; we should say, of "negative" electricity. Let us picture
 :  T9,
these electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it
 :  T9,
is suggested that there is a nucleus of "positive" electricity
 :  T9,
attracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an
 :  T9,
equilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.
 :  T9,
This nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two
 :  T9,
electricities in the atom :  T9,
the electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the
 :  T9,
electrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of
 :  T9,
violent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.

The radium rays are made to strike a screen, producing visible spots of

light. When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be

deflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an
 :  T9,
electric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained
 :  T9,
our knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]
 :  T9,
PROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]
 :  T9,
But we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the
 :  T9,
contending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally
 :  T9,
accepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or
 :  T9,
charges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive
 :  T9,
electricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of
 :  T9,
violent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up
 :  T9,
in the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we
 :  T9,
will notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand
 :  T9,
the nature of matter.
 :  T9,
A brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,
 :  T9,
some years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are
 :  T9,
arranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order
 :  T9,
of increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the
 :  T9,
atom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of
 :  T9,
atoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the
 :  T9,
heaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after
 :  T9,
element, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found
 :  T9,
a strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented
 :  T9,
by the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to
 :  T9,
uranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it
 :  T9,
probable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found
 :  T9,
eighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of
 :  T9,
electrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is
 :  T9,
arranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.
 :  T9,
§ 7
 :  T9,
The New View of Matter
 :  T9,
Up to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of
 :  T9,
Matter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole
 :  T9,
universe, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From
 :  T9,
the smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one
 :  T9,
electron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy
 :  T9,
complicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many
 :  T9,
electrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and
 :  T9,
negative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are
 :  T9,
particles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a
 :  T9,
manifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine
 :  T9,
and form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which
 :  T9,
nature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the
 :  T9,
whole universe.
 :  T9,
But more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other
 :  T9,
fundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give
 :  T9,
rise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that
 :  T9,
there are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite
 :  T9,
type of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to
 :  T9,
be said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the
 :  T9,
electron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists
 :  T9,
of our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and
 :  T9,
negative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists
 :  T9,
the theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,
 :  T9,
which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances
 :  T9,
of some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of
 :  T9,
energy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T9,
which constitutes matter itself.
 :  T9,
But the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many
 :  T9,
other interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.
 :  T9,
In radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is
 :  T9,
breaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of
 :  T9,
the spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a
 :  T9,
transmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.
 :  T9,
The element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes
 :  T9,
through a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each
 :  T9,
descending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The
 :  T9,
changing process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all
 :  T9,
matter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question
 :  T9,
whether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.
 :  T9,
There is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution
 :  T9,
in our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements
 :  T9,
are breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the
 :  T9,
more complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there
 :  T9,
not be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more
 :  T9,
complicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at
 :  T9,
work.
 :  T6, T9, T10,
There are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day :  T9,
they all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to
 :  T9,
element, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they
 :  T9,
were all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution
 :  T9,
in the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the
 :  T9,
evolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this
 :  T9,
inorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into
 :  T9,
the matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can
 :  T9,
be based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether
 :  T9,
the evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who
 :  T9,
maintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing
 :  T9,
enough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were
 :  T9,
evolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have
 :  T9,
_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which
 :  T9,
reference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are
 :  T9,
built up one from another.
 :  T9,
§ 8
 :  T9,
Other New Views
 :  T9,
We may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of
 :  T9,
radio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the
 :  T9,
earth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the
 :  T9,
earth as a body which is gradually cooling down, "losing its primitive
 :  T9,
heat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be
 :  T9,
calculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to
 :  T9,
contraction." Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and
 :  T9,
their discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,
 :  T9,
which are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.
 :  T9,
We cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may
 :  T9,
even, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the
 :  T9,
British Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge
 :  T9,
had extended the probable period during which there had been life on
 :  T9,
this globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of
 :  T9,
the earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is
 :  T9,
not cooling, but "contains an internal source of heat from the
 :  T9,
disintegration of uranium in the outer crust." On the whole the estimate
 :  T9,
obtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.
 :  T9,
The question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,
 :  T9,
be settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.
 :  T9,
Radium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the "Alpha," the "Beta"
 :  T9,
(electrons), and "Gamma" rays. The above illustration indicates the
 :  T9,
method by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the
 :  T9,
nature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is
 :  T9,
the instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium
 :  T9,
rays visible on a screen.
 :  T9,
The radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the
 :  T9,
screen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are
 :  T9,
observed by the magnifying lens.

 :  T9,

 :  T9,
An atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort
 :  T9,
of miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative
 :  T9,
electricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,
 :  T9,
as described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an
 :  T9,
atom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons
 :  T9,
move with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]
 :  T9,
The above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement
 :  T9,
of the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the
 :  T9,
X-ray spectra of the diamond.]
 :  T9,
As we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise
 :  T9,
to more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the
 :  T9,
physical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,
 :  T9,
outside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain
 :  T9,
ether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,
 :  T9,
however small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such
 :  T9,
thing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is
 :  T9,
in a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy "is the universal
 :  T9,
commodity on which all life depends." Separate and distinct as these
 :  T9,
three fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it
 :  T9,
may be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of
 :  T9,
an essential "oneness" of the universe.
 :  T9,
§ 9
 :  T9,
The Future
 :  T9,
Let us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the
 :  T9,
way in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable
 :  T9,
practically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are
 :  T9,
shot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.
 :  T9,
Sir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of
 :  T9,
radium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,
 :  T9,
thirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that
 :  T9,
it would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of
 :  T9,
one of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper
 :  T9,
coin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty
 :  T9,
million horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we
 :  T9,
could extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of
 :  T9,
hydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace
 :  T9,
the electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion
 :  T9,
revolutions a second!
 :  T9,
Every man asks at once :  T9,
no more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an
 :  T9,
atom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to
 :  T9,
another. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons
 :  T9,
being held together as has been described. If it were not so "the earth
 :  T9,
would explode and become a gaseous nebula"! It is believed that some day
 :  T9,
we shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. "I am
 :  T9,
of opinion," says Sir William Bragg, "that atom energy will supply our
 :  T9,
future need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,
 :  T9,
or to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the
 :  T9,
peculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in
 :  T9,
hand." Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The
 :  T9,
difficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there
 :  T9,
was just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam
 :  T9,
or electricity. "Is it to be supposed," he asks, "that there can be no
 :  T9,
fresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?" More than one
 :  T9,
man of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words
 :  T9,
written by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on
 :  T9,
radio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November
 :  T9,
6, 1919) :  T9,
    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial
 :  T9,
    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had
 :  T9,
    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative
 :  T9,
    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of
 :  T9,
    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the
 :  T9,
    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to
 :  T9,
    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has
 :  T9,
    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the
 :  T9,
    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical
 :  T9,
    renaissance of the whole world.
 :  T9,
If that "promise" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the
 :  T9,
world will be transformed.
 :  T9,
Before passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let
 :  T9,
us see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the
 :  T9,
nature and manipulation of electricity.
 :  T9,
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
 :  T9,
The Nature of Electricity
 :  T9,
There is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty
 :  T9,
years ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of
 :  T9,
all, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.
 :  T9,
Already, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our "age of
 :  T9,
electricity," yet there were few things in nature about which we knew
 :  T9,
less. The "electric current" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our
 :  T9,
rooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that
 :  T9,
it was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in
 :  T9,
a pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from
 :  T9,
atom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.
 :  T9,
Let us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see
 :  T9,
how it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about
 :  T9,
us. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive
 :  T9,
electricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of
 :  T9,
negative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what
 :  T9,
electricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with
 :  T9,
the usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that
 :  T9,
electricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of
 :  T9,
electricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a
 :  T9,
definite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of
 :  T9,
electricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and
 :  T9,
left-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but
 :  T9,
there are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.
 :  T9,
    [4] The words "positive" and "negative" electricity belong to the
 :  T9,
    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the
 :  T9,
    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.
 :  T9,
    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some
 :  T9,
    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of
 :  T9,
    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one
 :  T9,
    with more than the normal number of electrons.
 :  T9,
§ 10
 :  T9,
What an Electric Current is
 :  T9,
The discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us
 :  T9,
to understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The
 :  T9,
outlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on
 :  T9,
a large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,
 :  T9,
we believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,
 :  T9,
to begin with, a simple electrical "cell," in which a feeble current is
 :  T9,
generated :  T7, T9,
bells.
 :  T9,
In the original form this simple sort of "battery" consisted of a plate
 :  T9,
of zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before
 :  T9,
anything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc
 :  T9,
and copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know
 :  T9,
now what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly
 :  T9,
disposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not
 :  T9,
know; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a
 :  T9,
"current." Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was
 :  T9,
further found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in
 :  T9,
certain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals
 :  T9,
were connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern
 :  T9,
language, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that
 :  T9,
the atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their
 :  T9,
detachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more
 :  T9,
electrons to pass on to the copper.
 :  T9,
An atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.
 :  T9,
This substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium
 :  T9,
passes through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and
 :  T9,
finally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much
 :  T9,
faster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking
 :  T9,
5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that
 :  T9,
Radium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the
 :  T9,
substances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium
 :  T9,
has an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only
 :  T9,
206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]

SILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED
 :  T9,
The separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same
 :  T9,
kind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out
 :  T9,
as in the photograph.]
 :  T9,
When the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on
 :  T9,
the tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence
 :  T9,
fall together again.]
 :  T9,
This is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a
 :  T9,
distance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It
 :  T9,
is a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]
 :  T9,
ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS
 :  T9,
Take an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a
 :  T9,
silk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract
 :  T9,
any light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]
 :  T9,
Such cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,
 :  T9,
but the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of
 :  T9,
electrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as
 :  T9,
molecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,
 :  T9,
each standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,
 :  T9,
will knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.
 :  T9,
There is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves
 :  T9,
only a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,
 :  T9,
which sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,
 :  T9,
however, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of
 :  T9,
movement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We
 :  T9,
have seen how swiftly electrons travel.
 :  T9,
But how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual
 :  T9,
mechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is
 :  T9,
turned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical
 :  T9,
section later in this work. We are concerned here only with the
 :  T9,
principle, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with
 :  T9,
electrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage
 :  T9,
onward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is
 :  T9,
one of the best "conductors." So we lengthen the copper wire between the
 :  T9,
zinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,
 :  T9,
which are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the
 :  T9,
door, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons
 :  T9,
rushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into
 :  T9,
the mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.
 :  T9,
Copper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore
 :  T9,
so common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as
 :  T9,
stubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them "insulators," because
 :  T9,
they resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not
 :  T9,
easily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very
 :  T9,
good insulators for this reason.
 :  T9,
What the Dynamo does
 :  T9,
But even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in
 :  T9,
modern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the
 :  T9,
invisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a
 :  T9,
magnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the
 :  T9,
surrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the
 :  T9,
wire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set
 :  T9,
electrons moving on a large scale we use a "dynamo." By means of the
 :  T9,
dynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical
 :  T9,
energy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked
 :  T9,
upon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we
 :  T9,
would only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round
 :  T9,
rapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential
 :  T9,
construction of the "dynamo," which is used for generating strong
 :  T9,
currents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from
 :  T9,
electricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large
 :  T9,
magnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow
 :  T9,
of electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the
 :  T9,
speed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic
 :  T9,
field, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.
 :  T9,
It is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in
 :  T9,
the _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic
 :  T9,
field. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful
 :  T9,
current of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an
 :  T9,
"alternating" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it
 :  T9,
into a continuous current where this is necessary.
 :  T9,
A current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to
 :  T9,
atom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and
 :  T9,
explosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the
 :  T9,
occasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most
 :  T9,
spectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw
 :  T9,
earlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods
 :  T9,
of electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great
 :  T9,
numbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream
 :  T9,
of solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified
 :  T9,
atoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is
 :  T9,
constantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round
 :  T9,
the positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the
 :  T9,
earth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or
 :  T9,
becomes "negatively electrified." In the thunderstorm we get both kinds
 :  T9,
of clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in
 :  T9,
electrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a
 :  T9,
sudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or
 :  T9,
to the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.
 :  T9,
§ 11
 :  T9,
Magnetism
 :  T9,
We have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now
 :  T9,
an electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is
 :  T9,
endowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of
 :  T9,
magnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular
 :  T9,
idea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a
 :  T9,
piece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we
 :  T9,
shall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the
 :  T9,
iron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,
 :  T9,
due to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,
 :  T9,
an ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in
 :  T9,
movement, creates a magnetic "field," as it is called, round its path.
 :  T9,
There is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of
 :  T9,
energy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy
 :  T9,
disappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that
 :  T9,
all magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to
 :  T9,
arise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the
 :  T9,
ultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the
 :  T9,
theory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from
 :  T9,
other substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the
 :  T9,
electron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely
 :  T9,
_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future
 :  T9,
research. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the
 :  T9,
compass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is
 :  T9,
affected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it
 :  T9,
has been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons
 :  T9,
and that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a
 :  T9,
connection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the
 :  T9,
consequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of
 :  T9,
the connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.
 :  T9,
ETHER AND WAVES
 :  T9,
Ether and Waves
 :  T9,
The whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium
 :  T9,
called the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been
 :  T9,
abandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is
 :  T9,
ultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so
 :  T9,
deeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be
 :  T9,
understood unless we know something about the properties attributed to
 :  T9,
the ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and
 :  T9,
to account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time
 :  T9,
to travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8
 :  T9,
minutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the
 :  T9,
sun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our
 :  T9,
earth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown
 :  T9,
that light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in
 :  T9,
waves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever
 :  T9,
medium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and
 :  T9,
the air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler
 :  T9,
and feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear
 :  T9,
the bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_
 :  T9,
the bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The
 :  T9,
invisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,
 :  T9,
and this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the
 :  T9,
stars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;
 :  T9,
their light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We
 :  T9,
conceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.
 :  T9,
All the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,
 :  T9,
stored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and
 :  T9,
steamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the
 :  T9,
multifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without
 :  T9,
that universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,
 :  T9,
lifeless world.
 :  T9,
AN ELECTRIC SPARK
 :  T9,
An electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space
 :  T9,
between the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the
 :  T9,
ether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain
 :  T9,
limit the discharge takes place.]
 :  T9,
AN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT
 :  T9,
In the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the
 :  T9,
coil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a
 :  T9,
magnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as
 :  T9,
the electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the
 :  T9,
ether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the
 :  T9,
scissors fall.]
 :  T9,
We have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered
 :  T9,
as resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.
 :  T9,
The waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from
 :  T9,
crest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a
 :  T9,
pond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is
 :  T9,
enormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that
 :  T9,
constitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in
 :  T9,
length; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has
 :  T9,
the longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves
 :  T9,
of deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an
 :  T9,
inch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of
 :  T9,
deep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the
 :  T9,
waves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.
 :  T9,
Waves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and
 :  T9,
we can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length
 :  T9,
of the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until
 :  T9,
we come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.
 :  T9,
Below the Limits of Visibility
 :  T9,
But we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find
 :  T9,
that the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special
 :  T9,
photographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times
 :  T9,
longer than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility
 :  T9,
are waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a
 :  T9,
fire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our
 :  T9,
senses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer
 :  T9,
waves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect
 :  T9,
them by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless
 :  T9,
telegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.
 :  T9,
These waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant
 :  T9,
heat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ
 :  T9,
only as regards their wave-lengths.
 :  T9,
LIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
 :  T9,
If Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what
 :  T9,
gives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series
 :  T9,
of waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to
 :  T9,
the electron :  T1, T9, T10,
electrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons
 :  T9,
may be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their
 :  T9,
speed or vibration increased.
 :  T9,
Electrons and Light
 :  T9,
The particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.
 :  T9,
No nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but
 :  T9,
your cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of
 :  T9,
wave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of
 :  T9,
matter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.
 :  T9,
The particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,
 :  T9,
communicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.
 :  T9,
They move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are
 :  T9,
now able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the
 :  T9,
poker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It
 :  T9,
begins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very
 :  T9,
violently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they
 :  T9,
can be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still
 :  T9,
not affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds
 :  T9,
of electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into
 :  T9,
white light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in
 :  T9,
their orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron
 :  T9,
"blue hot," and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_
 :  T9,
waves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these
 :  T9,
there is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,
 :  T9,
which will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.
 :  T9,
Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light
 :  T9,
travelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,
 :  T9,
has moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the
 :  T9,
planet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when
 :  T9,
Jupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the
 :  T9,
moon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the
 :  T9,
planet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to
 :  T9,
cover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,
 :  T9,
and the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we
 :  T9,
easily get the velocity of light.
 :  T9,
No doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls
 :  T9,
of a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is
 :  T9,
so mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is
 :  T9,
reflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second
 :  T9,
which light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such
 :  T9,
speed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its
 :  T9,
return and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the
 :  T9,
ray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_
 :  T9,
to the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel
 :  T9,
was known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of
 :  T9,
light. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and
 :  T9,
light travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that
 :  T9,
about 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see "violet."
 :  T9,
Sorting out Light-waves
 :  T9,
The waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become
 :  T9,
faintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they
 :  T9,
become shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we
 :  T9,
get, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
 :  T9,
indigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of
 :  T9,
different length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of
 :  T9,
the sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,
 :  T9,
the speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls
 :  T9,
obliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths
 :  T9,
part company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a
 :  T9,
band of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their
 :  T9,
lengths in the "obstacle race" through the glass. Anyone may see this
 :  T9,
for himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the
 :  T9,
sunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its
 :  T9,
constituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite
 :  T9,
readily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven
 :  T9,
colours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the
 :  T9,
proportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel
 :  T9,
will appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But
 :  T9,
_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not
 :  T9,
appear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding
 :  T9,
to what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show
 :  T9,
that some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not
 :  T9,
permit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body
 :  T9,
that intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression
 :  T9,
of red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour
 :  T9,
seen.
 :  T9,
LIGHTNING
 :  T9,
In a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a
 :  T9,
violent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to
 :  T9,
another, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful
 :  T9,
photograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating
 :  T9,
flashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one
 :  T9,
hundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]
 :  T9,
Light consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light
 :  T9,
differ in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.
 :  T9,
Deep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves
 :  T9,
1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different
 :  T9,
wave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the
 :  T9,
length of the wave.]
 :  T9,
The electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the
 :  T9,
electric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic
 :  T9,
circuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the
 :  T9,
base of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]
 :  T9,
The illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines
 :  T9,
of force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of
 :  T9,
the other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the
 :  T9,
same magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north
 :  T9,
pole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the
 :  T9,
magnet is freely suspended.]
 :  T9,
The Fate of the World
 :  T9,
Professor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen
 :  T9,
when the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye
 :  T9,
"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's
 :  T9,
light, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is
 :  T9,
most.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,
 :  T9,
as to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the
 :  T9,
lapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has
 :  T9,
so rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become
 :  T9,
a dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no
 :  T9,
longer emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be
 :  T9,
in inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people
 :  T9,
then inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep
 :  T9,
themselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself
 :  T9,
to the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet
 :  T9,
and invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be
 :  T9,
luminous to them which would be dark to us."
 :  T9,
§ 12
 :  T9,
What the Blue "Sky" means
 :  T9,
We saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves
 :  T9,
into their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into
 :  T9,
its different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense
 :  T9,
moisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar
 :  T9,
example. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street
 :  T9,
or on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its
 :  T9,
surface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue
 :  T9,
"sky" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere
 :  T9,
catch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a
 :  T9,
tubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful
 :  T9,
pink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the
 :  T9,
west at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through
 :  T9,
denser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves
 :  T9,
are sifted out from the other shafts.
 :  T9,
Then there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves
 :  T9,
and reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and
 :  T9,
there is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces
 :  T9,
_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of
 :  T9,
vibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,
 :  T9,
as the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb
 :  T9,
either the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the
 :  T9,
wonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue
 :  T9,
to radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get
 :  T9,
from them "black" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.
 :  T9,
Other bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the
 :  T9,
light-waves and let them stream through.
 :  T9,
Light without Heat
 :  T9,
There are substances--"phosphorescent" things we call them--which give
 :  T9,
out a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems
 :  T9,
of science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce
 :  T9,
light without heat our "gas bill" would shrink amazingly. So much energy
 :  T9,
is wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which
 :  T9,
we do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in
 :  T9,
illumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead
 :  T9,
herring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know
 :  T9,
as yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial
 :  T9,
light is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The
 :  T9,
unwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted
 :  T9,
next morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour
 :  T9,
disclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.
 :  T9,
The Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which
 :  T9,
is compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be
 :  T9,
turned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
perceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the
 :  T9,
result of the union of the remaining six.]
 :  T9,
Beyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid
 :  T9,
waves--the "ultra-violet" waves--which are precious to the photographer.
 :  T9,
As every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that
 :  T9,
comes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means "no
 :  T9,
thoroughfare" for the blue and "beyond-blue" waves, and it is these
 :  T9,
which arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same
 :  T9,
waves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter
 :  T9,
(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as
 :  T9,
will be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves
 :  T9,
fanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the
 :  T9,
mighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we
 :  T9,
are prodigally using up.
 :  T9,
The X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of
 :  T9,
waves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively
 :  T9,
minute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern
 :  T9,
physicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were
 :  T9,
made to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It
 :  T9,
is about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about
 :  T9,
the 1/25 of an inch!
 :  T9,
One of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the
 :  T9,
sun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star
 :  T9,
is bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the
 :  T9,
sun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of
 :  T9,
a pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even
 :  T9,
calculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every
 :  T9,
year!
 :  T9,
ENERGY :  T1, T9, T10,
As we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities
 :  T9,
of the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called
 :  T9,
energy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,
 :  T9,
since all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it
 :  T9,
impossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more
 :  T9,
readily understood when we have considered what energy is.
 :  T9,
Energy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in
 :  T9,
various forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of
 :  T9,
what the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute
 :  T9,
matter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At
 :  T9,
the same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It
 :  T9,
is another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has
 :  T9,
in some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that
 :  T9,
energy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter
 :  T9,
itself.
 :  T6, T9,
Forms of Energy
 :  T9,
The existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for
 :  T9,
ages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by
 :  T9,
burning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential
 :  T9,
_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The
 :  T9,
conception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in
 :  T9,
amount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great
 :  T9,
scientific acquisitions of the past century.
 :  T9,
Wave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly
 :  T9,
complicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by
 :  T9,
superposing a number of simple wave forms.]
 :  T9,
The illustration is that of a "Phoenix" electric magnet lifting scrap
 :  T9,
from railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a
 :  T9,
weight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts
 :  T9,
a weight of 40 tons.]
 :  T9,
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
 :  T9,
A train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather
 :  T9,
more than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the
 :  T9,
equator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the
 :  T9,
rate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and
 :  T9,
one-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]
 :  T9,
on a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned
 :  T9,
rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be
 :  T9,
It is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is
 :  T9,
sufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is
 :  T9,
recognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which
 :  T9,
is most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling
 :  T9,
stone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of
 :  T9,
motion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in
 :  T9,
virtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire
 :  T9,
kinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a
 :  T9,
cliff.
 :  T9,
Energy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted
 :  T9,
directly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,
 :  T9,
for example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have
 :  T9,
mechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this
 :  T9,
way we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy
 :  T9,
of the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to
 :  T9,
supply the energy of huge electric power stations.
 :  T9,
What Heat is
 :  T9,
An important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the
 :  T9,
form of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a
 :  T9,
waterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles
 :  T9,
of water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical
 :  T9,
changes are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent
 :  T9,
indefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and
 :  T9,
we have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other
 :  T9,
radio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. "Every hour
 :  T9,
radium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own
 :  T9,
weight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point." And what
 :  T9,
is heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,
 :  T9,
as we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,
 :  T9,
and the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal
 :  T9,
burns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently
 :  T9,
agitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as
 :  T9,
light and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we
 :  T9,
have a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.
 :  T9,
That energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been
 :  T9,
found to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first
 :  T9,
showed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be
 :  T9,
transformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an
 :  T9,
apparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by
 :  T9,
falling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,
 :  T9,
the water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been
 :  T9,
used up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between
 :  T9,
these two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in
 :  T9,
nature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of
 :  T9,
energy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of
 :  T9,
the Conservation of Energy.
 :  T9,
§ 13
 :  T9,
Substitutes for Coal
 :  T9,
Consider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern
 :  T9,
civilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now
 :  T9,
exists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical
 :  T9,
transformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our
 :  T9,
whole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal
 :  T9,
derived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's
 :  T9,
rays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and
 :  T9,
had been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential
 :  T9,
energy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.
 :  T9,
The exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge
 :  T9,
extends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other
 :  T9,
known sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling
 :  T9,
water; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge
 :  T9,
electric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to
 :  T9,
utilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of
 :  T9,
moving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy
 :  T9,
of the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared
 :  T9,
with the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British
 :  T9,
Association meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise
 :  T9,
the internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very
 :  T9,
practical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would
 :  T9,
be found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,
 :  T9,
as we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical
 :  T9,
energy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,
 :  T9,
then our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear
 :  T9,
it now is to all thoughtful men.
 :  T9,
The stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we
 :  T9,
cannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy
 :  T9,
cannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider
 :  T9,
what this important fact means.
 :  T9,
§ 14
 :  T10,
Dissipation of Energy
 :  T10,
Energy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is
 :  T10,
indestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question
 :  T10,
than to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,
 :  T10,
where an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the
 :  T10,
reader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by
 :  T10,
physicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,
 :  T10,
until it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the
 :  T10,
iron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding
 :  T10,
bodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some
 :  T10,
measure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,
 :  T10,
but ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot
 :  T10,
follow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat
 :  T10,
energy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all
 :  T10,
bodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as
 :  T10,
heat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the
 :  T10,
effect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies
 :  T10,
acquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is
 :  T10,
measured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.
 :  T10,
There must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if
 :  T10,
all the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty
 :  T10,
infinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is
 :  T10,
hotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the
 :  T10,
same temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of
 :  T10,
heat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions
 :  T10,
between those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same
 :  T10,
principle applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat
 :  T10,
energy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.
 :  T10,
If the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although
 :  T10,
it might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be
 :  T10,
unavailable.
 :  T10,
What a Uniform Temperature would mean
 :  T10,
And what does this imply? It implies a great deal :  T10,
in the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease
 :  T10,
to be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat
 :  T10,
radiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,
 :  T10,
in which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it
 :  T10,
would have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the
 :  T10,
universe is running down.
 :  T10,
The energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate
 :  T10,
thousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is
 :  T10,
used to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]
 :  T10,
TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY
 :  T10,
An illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by
 :  T10,
firing the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient
 :  T10,
to impart violent motion to tons of water.]
 :  T10,
"BOILING" A KETTLE ON ICE
 :  T10,
When a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it "boils" because
 :  T10,
the ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of
 :  T10,
the liquid air_.]
 :  T10,
If all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that
 :  T10,
substance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be
 :  T10,
nothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would
 :  T10,
cease is known :  T10,
temperature than this :  T10,
exists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,
 :  T10,
whereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this
 :  T10,
absolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body
 :  T10,
in the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go
 :  T10,
on for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise
 :  T10,
temperatures.
 :  T10,
But we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.
 :  T10,
If the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be
 :  T10,
_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.
 :  T10,
Some authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the
 :  T10,
living body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of
 :  T10,
food is transformed directly into work without any of it being
 :  T10,
dissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will
 :  T10,
finally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while
 :  T10,
energy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.
 :  T10,
The primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the
 :  T10,
atom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which
 :  T10,
nature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we
 :  T10,
can replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can
 :  T10,
call into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in
 :  T10,
uniform temperature?
 :  T10,
    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,
 :  T10,
    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of
 :  T10,
    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy
 :  T10,
    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy
 :  T10,
    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace
 :  T10,
    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,
 :  T10,
    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle
 :  T10,
    for existence.[5]
 :  T10,
    [5] _Matter and Energy_, by Professor Soddy.
 :  T10,
It is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,
 :  T10,
and that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are
 :  T10,
receptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities
 :  T10,
really are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of
 :  T10,
energy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity
 :  T10,
which constitutes matter :  T9, T10,
electricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an
 :  T10,
answer is :  T6, T7, T10,
§ 15
 :  T10,
MATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN
 :  T10,
The supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of
 :  T10,
nature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative
 :  T10,
electricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of
 :  T10,
disturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our
 :  T10,
"energies" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of
 :  T10,
some kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.
 :  T10,
It is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that
 :  T10,
the electron is a tiny whirlpool, or "vortex," in ether; and, as such a
 :  T10,
vortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a
 :  T10,
possibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the
 :  T10,
difficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is
 :  T10,
unknown. A recent view is that it is "a ring of negative electricity
 :  T10,
rotating about its axis at a high speed," though that does not carry us
 :  T10,
very far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must
 :  T10,
be content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward
 :  T10,
the final unification.
 :  T10,
We say "unification," but it would be a grave error to think that ether
 :  T10,
is the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential
 :  T10,
part of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an
 :  T10,
imagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,
 :  T10,
and which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as
 :  T10,
an elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of
 :  T10,
the universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of
 :  T10,
186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter
 :  T10,
passed through it as if it did not exist.
 :  T10,
Some years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of
 :  T10,
detecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must
 :  T10,
move through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream
 :  T10,
of ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship
 :  T10,
through a still atmosphere will make "a wind." In 1887 Michelson and
 :  T10,
Morley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the
 :  T10,
direction of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray
 :  T10,
of light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and
 :  T10,
scores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there
 :  T10,
is no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would
 :  T10,
appear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of
 :  T10,
the light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence
 :  T10,
of ether. J. H. Jeans says that "nature acts as if no such thing
 :  T10,
existed." Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not
 :  T10,
imply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The
 :  T10,
primary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is
 :  T10,
that, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.
 :  T10,
If there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there
 :  T10,
should be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been
 :  T10,
tried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very
 :  T10,
sensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by
 :  T10,
revolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such
 :  T10,
motion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that
 :  T10,
the usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this
 :  T10,
theory more fully in a later section.
 :  T10,
INFLUENCE OF THE TIDES :  T10,
§ 16
 :  T10,
Until comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of
 :  T10,
modern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's
 :  T10,
mysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this
 :  T10,
mysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is
 :  T10,
not surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to
 :  T10,
some imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when
 :  T10,
man first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was
 :  T10,
somehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?
 :  T10,
What bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and
 :  T10,
the diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an
 :  T10,
ancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned
 :  T10,
himself in the sea.
 :  T10,
The Earth Pulled by the Moon
 :  T10,
But it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation
 :  T10,
that it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can
 :  T10,
see, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal
 :  T10,
attraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,
 :  T10,
pulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that
 :  T10,
part of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for
 :  T10,
instance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,
 :  T10,
_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a
 :  T10,
sort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water
 :  T10,
is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small
 :  T10,
tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also
 :  T10,
that a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of
 :  T10,
the earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more
 :  T10,
loosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface
 :  T10,
were entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression
 :  T10,
that these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once
 :  T10,
every day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there
 :  T10,
would be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the
 :  T10,
simplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.
 :  T10,
The tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser
 :  T10,
degree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose
 :  T10,
and mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,
 :  T10,
although small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The
 :  T10,
effect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is
 :  T10,
explained in the text.]

THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT
 :  T10,
An exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The
 :  T10,
wall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be
 :  T10,
noticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river
 :  T10,
heads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing
 :  T10,
slope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the
 :  T10,
combined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the
 :  T10,
text.]
 :  T9, T10,
A BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the
 :  T10,
complete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have
 :  T10,
just outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,
 :  T10,
for instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the
 :  T10,
moon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High
 :  T10,
water at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours
 :  T10,
after the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water
 :  T10,
occurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.
 :  T10,
The actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,
 :  T10,
nevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high
 :  T10,
water for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a
 :  T10,
considerable time ahead.
 :  T10,
The Action of Sun and Moon
 :  T10,
It would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,
 :  T10,
but we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.
 :  T10,
Since the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we
 :  T10,
should expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much
 :  T10,
stronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first
 :  T10,
sight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the
 :  T10,
sun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than
 :  T10,
those produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a
 :  T10,
matter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is
 :  T10,
that _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The
 :  T10,
mass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand
 :  T10,
it is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than
 :  T10,
counterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is
 :  T10,
that the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon
 :  T10,
act together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they
 :  T10,
act against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are
 :  T10,
further complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at
 :  T10,
various places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and
 :  T10,
falls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls
 :  T10,
more than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.
 :  T10,
§ 17
 :  T10,
Origin of the Moon
 :  T10,
But there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater
 :  T10,
interest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In
 :  T10,
the hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides
 :  T10,
had been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In
 :  T10,
particular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the
 :  T10,
system formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages
 :  T10,
ago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that
 :  T10,
the moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In
 :  T10,
that remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the
 :  T10,
earth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one
 :  T10,
body, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into
 :  T10,
two pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became
 :  T10,
the moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination
 :  T10,
of the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by
 :  T10,
the tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's
 :  T10,
coastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced
 :  T10,
to rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in
 :  T10,
movement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be
 :  T10,
created from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this
 :  T10,
colossal expenditure possible.
 :  T10,
The Earth Slowing down
 :  T10,
The answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the
 :  T10,
rotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every
 :  T10,
twenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of
 :  T10,
its rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the
 :  T10,
heaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is
 :  T10,
only working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense
 :  T10,
energy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from
 :  T10,
this reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the
 :  T10,
energy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing
 :  T10,
down the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's
 :  T10,
rotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind
 :  T10,
of dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,
 :  T10,
measured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,
 :  T10,
continuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in
 :  T10,
astronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable
 :  T10,
results.
 :  T10,
But there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary
 :  T10,
mathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the
 :  T10,
earth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The
 :  T10,
tides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon
 :  T10,
farther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not
 :  T10,
permit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical
 :  T10,
principle, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.
 :  T10,
Some interesting consequences follow.
 :  T10,
Since the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating
 :  T10,
faster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only
 :  T10,
twenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,
 :  T10,
until, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its
 :  T10,
axis in a period of from three to four hours.
 :  T10,
At this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We
 :  T10,
have seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.
 :  T10,
It follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was
 :  T10,
nearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer
 :  T10,
to an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have
 :  T10,
already mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in
 :  T10,
three or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost
 :  T10,
grazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that
 :  T10,
there is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity
 :  T10,
beyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal
 :  T10,
force developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules
 :  T10,
of the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we
 :  T10,
have traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with
 :  T10,
immense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was
 :  T10,
barely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an
 :  T10,
age more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces
 :  T10,
is the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin
 :  T10,
of the earth-moon system.
 :  T10,
The Day Becoming Longer
 :  T10,
At the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously
 :  T10,
must have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the
 :  T10,
same time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day
 :  T10,
were of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,
 :  T10,
the month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began
 :  T10,
to get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the
 :  T10,
earth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the
 :  T10,
month increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month
 :  T10,
became equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been
 :  T10,
calculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days
 :  T10,
in the month. After that the number of days in the month began to
 :  T10,
decrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will
 :  T10,
continue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In
 :  T10,
that age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of
 :  T10,
the tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;
 :  T10,
it will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round
 :  T10,
the earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of
 :  T10,
affairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides
 :  T10,
to be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun
 :  T10,
has a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on
 :  T10,
its axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of
 :  T10,
course, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go
 :  T10,
round the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the
 :  T10,
moon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.
 :  T10,
Surprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this
 :  T10,
possibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one
 :  T10,
half-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars
 :  T10,
were discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved
 :  T10,
round Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,
 :  T10,
therefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete
 :  T10,
revolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there
 :  T10,
would be more than three months in a day.

Literary Archive Foundation
 :  T10,
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 :  T10,
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 :  T10,
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 :  T10,
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 :  T10,
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 :  T10,
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 :  T10,
status with the IRS.
 :  T10,
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 :  T10,
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 :  T10,
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 :  T10,
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 :  T10,
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 :  T10,
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 :  T10,
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

particular state visit http :  T10,

approach us with offers to donate.
 :  T10,
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 :  T10,
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 :  T10,
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 :  T10,
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 :  T10,
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 :  T10,
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 :  T10,
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 :  T10,
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 :  T10,
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 :  T10,
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility :  T10,
